    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why the First 90 Days Define Your Territory Performance</h2>
        <p>When a medical device rep inherits a territory, the default approach is to start calling on the accounts the previous rep liked. This is how underperforming territories stay underperforming. The accounts that got the most attention were not necessarily the highest-potential accounts. They were the ones where the previous rep had relationships, or the ones closest to their home, or the ones that always took a meeting even if they never bought.</p>

<p>A structured territory assessment in the first 90 days prevents this. It replaces inherited assumptions with data, identifies accounts that were overlooked or underworked, and produces a prioritized plan based on opportunity rather than habit. Reps who complete a rigorous 90-day assessment typically outperform peers who "hit the ground running" by the end of their first year. The short-term cost of time spent on analysis is more than offset by the long-term gain of working the right accounts.</p>

<p><strong>What this playbook covers.</strong> This is a week-by-week guide in three phases. Weeks 1-2: audit the data you have. Weeks 3-4: build a complete provider census. Month 2: account tiering using procedure volumes, technology, and competitive intelligence. Month 3: execution planning with prioritized target lists, account plans, and competitive displacement opportunities. At each phase, we show how provider data accelerates the work.</p>

<p><strong>Who this is for.</strong> Field sales reps at medical device companies who sell to surgeons, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), or specialty practices. The principles also work for healthcare IT reps, though the specific data points will differ.</p>

<p><strong>What you need to get started.</strong> Access to your CRM (even if the data is poor), a list of zip codes or counties in your territory, and access to a provider data source. If your company provides a platform like <a href="https://www.definitivehc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Definitive Healthcare</a>, use it. If not, public data sources combined with a service like Provyx can fill the gap.</p>

        <h2>Weeks 1-2: The Data Audit</h2>
        <p>Before you visit a single account, understand what you know and what you do not know about your territory. This is the data audit phase.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Export your CRM data.</strong> Pull every account in your territory from the CRM. For each account, note: account name, address, last activity date, current status (customer, prospect, competitor account), primary contact, and any notes from the previous rep. Export this to a spreadsheet where you can work with it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Assess data quality.</strong> How many accounts have a last activity date within the past 12 months? How many have a valid primary contact? How many have current information about the technology or devices installed? In a typical inherited territory, 30-50% of CRM accounts will have no activity in the past year, and 20-40% will have outdated or missing contact information. This is normal. Do not panic; just quantify the gap.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Identify the gaps.</strong> The most dangerous gap is accounts that should be in your CRM but are not. The previous rep may not have added newer practices, recently opened ASCs, or facilities that were not on the legacy target list. You will address this in the provider census phase, but for now, note that your CRM likely represents an incomplete picture of your territory.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Audit competitive intelligence.</strong> What do you know about which competitors are installed at each account? CRM notes may reference competitor products, but this data is often anecdotal and outdated. Flag accounts where competitive information is missing or more than 12 months old. Competitive intelligence is one of the highest-value data points for territory planning, and its absence is a priority to address.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Review historical performance data.</strong> If available, pull the sales history for your territory over the past 2-3 years. Identify: which accounts generated revenue, how much, and how recently. Which accounts were lost to competitors and when. Which accounts were never converted despite being in the pipeline. This history tells you where there is momentum, where there are competitive threats, and where the previous rep hit a wall.</p>

<p><strong>Output from Weeks 1-2:</strong> A spreadsheet with every known account, data quality scores for each, a list of data gaps to fill, and a historical performance summary. This is your baseline. Everything that follows builds on this audit.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Weeks 3-4: Building the Provider Census</h2>
        <p>The data audit told you what you know. The provider census tells you what your territory actually contains. This is where provider data transforms your territory understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Define your target universe.</strong> Start with the geographic boundaries of your territory (zip codes, counties, or metro areas) and the specialties relevant to your device. If you sell orthopedic implants, your primary targets are orthopedic surgeons and the facilities where they operate. If you sell surgical instruments for general surgery, your universe is broader. Use the <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPI Registry</a> taxonomy codes to define the specialties precisely. A provider data service like Provyx can deliver a complete list filtered by geography, specialty, and facility type.</p>

<p><strong>Enumerate providers by specialty.</strong> For each target specialty, count the total number of active providers in your territory. Break this down by subspecialty if relevant (e.g., within orthopedics: spine, joints, sports medicine, trauma). This is your provider census. Compare it to the number of providers in your CRM. The delta represents providers you are not currently tracking. In most territories, the CRM captures 50-70% of the actual provider universe. The missing 30-50% includes newer practitioners, those at facilities the previous rep did not visit, and providers whose NPI data did not match the legacy CRM import.</p>

<p><strong>Map facilities.</strong> Providers operate at facilities, and facility mapping is critical for device sales. List every hospital, ASC, imaging center, and specialty practice in your territory that is relevant to your product. For each facility, note: type (hospital, ASC, practice), size (beds, OR suites, or provider count), ownership (independent, health system-affiliated), and current technology or device installations if known. Provyx's <a href="/services/practice-location-data/">practice location data</a> provides facility-level information including addresses, practice size indicators, and organizational affiliations.</p>

<p><strong>Identify new and growing accounts.</strong> Look for facilities that have opened in the past 1-2 years or that show signs of growth (new locations, additional providers, expanded services). New ASCs are particularly high-value targets for device reps because they are actively selecting equipment and have not yet committed to vendors. State licensing databases and <a href="https://data.cms.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS facility data</a> can help identify newly certified facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Output from Weeks 3-4:</strong> A complete provider census for your territory showing every relevant provider and facility, with gaps between your CRM and the actual universe clearly identified. This becomes the foundation for account tiering.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Month 2: Account Tiering</h2>
        <p>You now have a complete picture of your territory. The next step is deciding where to spend your time. Account tiering ranks every account by potential and assigns appropriate engagement levels.</p>

<p><strong>Tiering criteria for medical device territories.</strong> Four factors drive account tier assignment:</p>

<p><strong>1. Procedure volume.</strong> How many relevant procedures does this facility or surgeon perform? A surgeon who performs 200 joint replacements per year represents more revenue than one who performs 20. Facility-level data is available through <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-provider-utilization-payment-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS Medicare utilization data</a> (free but Medicare-only) and commercial claims databases. Even a rough estimate based on facility size and specialty mix is better than none.</p>

<p><strong>2. Technology and competitive landscape.</strong> What does this account currently use? Accounts with your products are retention priorities. Accounts using a competitor with a known vulnerability (recall, quality issue, expiring contract) are displacement opportunities. Greenfield accounts use no product in your category. Each requires a different strategy. <a href="/services/technology-detection/">Technology detection data</a> helps identify what is installed.</p>

<p><strong>3. Organizational characteristics.</strong> Independent practices make purchasing decisions locally and move quickly. Health system-affiliated facilities often follow system-wide contracts negotiated centrally. A Tier A independent ASC may be easier to win than a Tier A hospital within a GPO contract. <a href="/services/practice-firmographics/">Practice firmographic data</a> helps classify accounts by ownership structure.</p>

<p><strong>4. Relationship status.</strong> Where does your company stand with this account? Existing customer with strong relationships (protect and grow), former customer who left (win-back with a story), known prospect who has been engaged before (advance the conversation), or unknown account that has never been contacted (qualify and introduce). Relationship status modifies the priority and the approach, even if the other factors are favorable.</p>

<p><strong>Assign tiers.</strong> A simple four-tier model works for most territories. Tier A: high volume, strong competitive opportunity, manageable organizational complexity. Tier B: moderate volume or strong competitive opportunity. Tier C: lower volume but worth periodic engagement. Tier D: minimal volume or locked into long-term competitive contracts. Aim for 15-20% of accounts in Tier A, 25-30% in Tier B, 30-35% in Tier C, and the remainder in Tier D. Visit Tier A accounts weekly, Tier B biweekly, Tier C monthly, and Tier D quarterly or as needed.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Month 3: Building the Execution Plan</h2>
        <p>Tiering tells you where to focus. The execution plan tells you what to do at each account and in what sequence. Month 3 is about translating analysis into a concrete 90-day action plan.</p>

<p><strong>Prioritized target list.</strong> Rank your Tier A and Tier B accounts by a combination of revenue potential and competitive vulnerability. The top 10-15 accounts on this list are your primary focus for the next quarter. For each, define: the specific opportunity (new adoption, competitive displacement, product expansion), the key decision-maker (surgeon, administrator, materials manager), and the next action (introductory meeting, product evaluation, case observation). This list should be short enough to memorize. If you cannot name your top 10 accounts without looking at a spreadsheet, your list is too long or you have not internalized it.</p>

<p><strong>Account plans for Tier A.</strong> Each Tier A account gets a one-page plan. Include: current situation (what they use, who the key contacts are, recent interactions), objective (what you want to achieve in 90 days), strategy (how you will get there), and specific actions with dates. Account plans do not need to be elaborate. A half-page of clear, specific information is better than a three-page template filled with generic language.</p>

<p><strong>Competitive displacement playbook.</strong> For accounts where you are displacing a competitor, document: which competitor product is installed, why the account might switch (contract timing, dissatisfaction signals, clinical limitations), what your differentiation is for this specific account, and who the internal advocate might be. Build a short list of 5-10 competitive displacement targets where the timing and signals are favorable. These are your highest-return opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Activity cadence.</strong> Block your calendar according to your tiering. A common cadence: 3-4 Tier A visits per week, 2-3 Tier B visits, 1-2 prospecting activities, and one half-day for planning and CRM updates. The specific numbers depend on territory geography, but a defined cadence prevents drift toward low-value activities.</p>

<p><strong>Track and adjust.</strong> Review tier assignments monthly as you gather new information from field visits. Some accounts will move up; others will move down as you learn they are locked into contracts or lack volume. The 90-day assessment creates the foundation for a territory management discipline you maintain throughout your tenure.</p>

        <h2>How Provider Data Accelerates Each Phase</h2>
        <p>Every phase of the 90-day assessment benefits from provider data. Here is a summary of which data types matter at each stage and where to get them.</p>

<p><strong>Data audit (Weeks 1-2).</strong> You need clean provider records to compare against your CRM. An NPI-linked provider database lets you match your CRM contacts to verified records and identify outdated information. Provyx's <a href="/services/provider-contact-data/">provider contact data</a> includes NPI numbers, current practice addresses, specialty classifications, and verified contact information. Running a match between your CRM export and a current provider database immediately reveals stale records and missing contacts.</p>

<p><strong>Provider census (Weeks 3-4).</strong> You need a complete list of providers and facilities in your territory, filtered by specialty and geography. The NPI Registry provides the foundation, but commercial provider data adds practice affiliations, facility details, and contact information that NPPES does not include. <a href="/services/practice-location-data/">Practice location data</a> helps you map every facility in your territory, including recently opened practices and ASCs that may not be in your CRM.</p>

<p><strong>Account tiering (Month 2).</strong> Tiering requires multiple data dimensions. Procedure volume data comes from CMS or commercial claims databases. Technology install data comes from Provyx's <a href="/services/technology-detection/">technology detection</a> service or enterprise platforms like Definitive Healthcare. Practice firmographics, including ownership structure, provider count, and organizational affiliations, come from <a href="/services/practice-firmographics/">firmographic data</a> sources. The combination of these data types enables tiering that reflects actual account potential rather than gut feel.</p>

<p><strong>Execution planning (Month 3).</strong> The execution plan requires actionable contact data: verified email addresses, direct phone numbers, and the correct contact for each role at each account. Stale contact data wastes time and creates poor first impressions. Refreshing your contact data at the start of execution ensures you are reaching the right people. Provyx's data includes email verification and phone validation to reduce bounce rates and bad numbers.</p>

<p><strong>The ROI of data in the first 90 days.</strong> A rep who spends $2,000-$5,000 on provider data and identifies 10 high-potential accounts missing from their CRM will likely generate more revenue from those accounts than the data cost. Provider data does not replace field work, but it directs field work toward the highest-value opportunities from day one.</p>

                <h3>How much time should a new medical device rep spend on territory assessment vs. selling?</h3>
                <p>Roughly 40-50% of your time in the first two weeks, decreasing to 20-30% in weeks 3-4, and 10-15% in months 2-3. You should be visiting accounts from week 1, but the visits in the first month are as much about gathering intelligence as about selling. By month 3, you should be spending 80%+ of your time on active selling against your prioritized target list.</p>
                <h3>What if my company does not provide a data platform like Definitive Healthcare?</h3>
                <p>Many device companies, especially smaller ones, do not license enterprise data platforms.

Provyx is designed for this scenario: practice-level data without requiring a $30,000+ enterprise subscription. See our healthcare data providers for small teams guide.</p>
                <h3>How often should I update my account tiers?</h3>
                <p>Review tiers monthly during your first six months and quarterly after that. Tier changes should be driven by new information: a competitive contract expires, a new surgeon joins a practice, a facility expands services, or you learn that an account's volume is higher or lower than estimated. Major tiering overhauls should happen annually, incorporating updated procedure volume data and technology install information.</p>
                <h3>Should I focus on defending existing customers or winning new accounts?</h3>
                <p>Both, but with a bias toward protecting revenue. A general rule: spend 40% of your time on existing customers (retention and expansion), 40% on high-potential competitive displacement opportunities, and 20% on new account prospecting. Losing an existing customer hurts more than missing a new one. That said, if you inherit a territory with few existing customers, shift the ratio toward new business.</p>
