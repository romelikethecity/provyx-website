# CLAUDE.md - Provyx Website

## Project Overview
- Provyx (getprovyx.com) is a healthcare provider business data company
- Sells provider contact data (NPI, emails, phones, addresses) sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases
- NOT patient health data (PHI), NOT medical advice - this is B2B data vendor in healthcare vertical
- Target customers (ICP): healthcare marketing agencies, medical device sales teams, healthcare SaaS vendors, pharma sales teams, medical staffing agencies, healthcare consulting firms, health IT companies

## Architecture
- Pure static HTML/CSS/JS on GitHub Pages
- ALL pages (core + programmatic) generated by Python build system: `python3 scripts/build.py`
- Nav/footer baked into every HTML page at build time (CROReport pattern, NOT client-side JS injection)
- No frameworks, no build tools beyond Python
- Single CSS file with BEM naming, CSS cache busting via ?v=N query param

## Key Files
- `scripts/nav_config.py` - Single source of truth for all navigation links, site info
- `scripts/templates.py` - Shared HTML generators (head, nav, footer, breadcrumbs, FAQ, CTA)
- `scripts/build.py` - Master build script generates ALL pages + sitemap.xml
- `css/styles.css` - Full CSS system (light theme)
- `js/main.js` - Smooth scroll, header shadow, form handling (minimal)
- `CNAME` - getprovyx.com
- `robots.txt` - Allow all, sitemap pointer

## Programmatic SEO - Hub-and-Spoke Model

- ~130 subtype spoke pages at /providers/{subtype}/
- 7 ICP/audience pages at /for/{slug}/
- 3 comparison pages at /compare/{slug}/
- 2 alternative pages at /alternatives/{slug}/
- Provider directory index at /providers/
- ~170 total pages

### Categories (17 hubs):
mental-health, chiropractic, dental, dermatology, primary-care, senior-care, integrative-medicine, medical-spas, womens-health, eye-care, orthopedics, pain-management, physical-therapy, plastic-surgery, rheumatology, weight-loss, neurology

## SEO Rules
- Title tags: 50-60 chars, keyword-first, hyphens not pipes
- Meta descriptions: 120-158 chars, action-oriented, unique per page
- H1: one per page, 46-60 chars
- Canonical URL on every page (absolute)
- BreadcrumbList schema on every non-homepage page
- FAQPage schema on pages with FAQ sections
- Organization + WebSite schema on homepage
- OG + Twitter card meta tags on every page
- 3+ internal links per page
- 2+ outbound links to authoritative sources per content page (CMS NPI Registry, BLS, specialty associations)
- Minimum ~500 words per programmatic page

## Writing Style
- DO: contractions, varied sentence length, specific industry details, second-person "you", admit limitations, pain-first messaging
- DON'T: em-dashes, "leverage/utilize/robust/seamless/cutting-edge", "In today's fast-paced...", "Let's dive in", rhetorical questions, uniform list items, exclamation points

## YMYL Messaging
- Say "healthcare provider business data" or "provider contact intelligence", never just "healthcare data"
- Be explicit about sources: "sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases"
- Frame expertise as data operations and B2B intelligence, not healthcare expertise
- Don't mention HIPAA proactively - we don't handle PHI

## Founder
- Rome - credentials: Datajoy (acquired by Databricks), Microsoft, Salesforce, Snapdocs, UC Berkeley Haas MBA
- Expertise framing: data operations, B2B data enrichment, healthcare provider intelligence

## CSS Cache Busting
