# CLAUDE.md - Provyx Website

## Project Overview
- Provyx (getprovyx.com) is a healthcare provider business data company
- Sells provider contact data (NPI, emails, phones, addresses) sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases
- NOT patient health data (PHI), NOT medical advice - this is B2B data vendor in healthcare vertical
- Target customers (ICP): healthcare marketing agencies, medical device sales teams, healthcare SaaS vendors, pharma sales teams, medical staffing agencies, healthcare consulting firms, health IT companies

## Architecture
- Pure static HTML/CSS/JS on GitHub Pages
- ALL pages (core + programmatic) generated by Python build system: `python3 scripts/build.py`

- No frameworks, no build tools beyond Python
- Single CSS file with BEM naming, CSS cache busting via ?v=N query param

## Key Files
- `scripts/nav_config.py` - Single source of truth for all navigation links, site info
- `scripts/templates.py` - Shared HTML generators (head, nav, footer, breadcrumbs, FAQ, CTA)
- `scripts/build.py` - Master build script generates ALL pages + sitemap.xml

## Comparison Article Format (from CROReport)
Reference: https://thecroreport.com/tools/ai-sdr/11x-vs-artisan/

### Required Sections (in order), 3,000-5,000 words total:
1. **Hero** - Badge ("PROVIDER DATA COMPARISON"), H1 ("{Tool A} vs {Tool B}: {Honest Hook}"), lead paragraph, "Short Version" verdict callout box
2. **Stats Grid** - 4 key metrics in stat cards (pricing, contract terms, key differentiator, risk indicator)
3. **Quick Comparison Table** - 6-8 row table: Factor | Tool A | Tool B (pricing, contracts, data coverage, NPI verification, best for, big risk)
4. **Deep Dive: Tool A** (800-1,200 words) - Company card with metadata (founded, funding, HQ), alert box for red flags/news, "What They're Selling You" prose, "What It Actually Costs" with sourced pricing, user quotes with attribution, pros/cons grid (checkmark/X format)
5. **Deep Dive: Tool B** (800-1,200 words) - Same structure as Tool A
6. **Stage-Specific Guidance** (150-250 words per stage) - "So Which One Should You Actually Buy?" with 3 buyer segments:
   - Small teams (under 5 reps): colored alert box with verdict
   - Growth teams (5-20 reps): caution box with cost analysis
   - Enterprise (20+ reps): info box with options
7. **The Honest Take** (~300 words) - "Why Most of You Should Skip {Tool}" with meta-problem analysis, "Bottom Line" subsection with actionable bullet points
8. **Questions to Ask Before Signing** - 8-10 specific vendor-vetting questions in ordered list, bold question + explanation format
9. **Alternatives Table** - 4-6 lower-risk options: Tool | Price | Contract | Best For, closing insight about contract terms
10. **Author Bio** - Rome's credentials, LinkedIn link
11. **CTA Section** - Lead to contact form
12. **Disclosure + Sources** - Transparency statement, last updated date, source list

### Comparison Writing Rules:
- Every factual claim needs a linked source
- Bad: "Users report terrible results"
- Good: "One G2 reviewer noted 15% bounce rates on provider emails." [with link]
- All user quotes need attribution and link
- Pricing must be sourced or labeled "Not Public"
- Use color-coded tags in tables: red (bad), yellow (caution), green (good)
- Show your thinking with natural pauses and visible reasoning
- Be honest about both tools - don't just sell Provyx

## Writing Style
- DO: contractions, varied sentence length, specific industry details, second-person "you", admit limitations, pain-first messaging
- DON'T: em-dashes, "leverage/utilize/robust/seamless/cutting-edge", "In today's fast-paced...", "Let's dive in", rhetorical questions, uniform list items, exclamation points

## YMYL Messaging
- Say "healthcare provider business data" or "provider contact intelligence", never just "healthcare data"
- Be explicit about sources: "sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases"
- Frame expertise as data operations and B2B intelligence, not healthcare expertise
- Don't mention HIPAA proactively - we don't handle PHI

## Founder
- Rome - credentials: Datajoy (acquired by Databricks), Microsoft, Salesforce, Snapdocs, UC Berkeley Haas MBA
- Expertise framing: data operations, B2B data enrichment, healthcare provider intelligence

## Reference Projects
- /Users/rome/Documents/projects/verum-website/ - Original dark theme site (verum CSS/JS/architecture reference)
- /Users/rome/Documents/croreport/ - CROReport project (build-time nav/footer pattern reference)

## Build & Deploy
- Build: `python3 scripts/build.py` (generates all HTML + sitemap.xml)
- Local test: `python -m http.server 8000` from project root
- Deploy: GitHub Pages with CNAME, SSL via Cloudflare
- Analytics: GA4 only (no Microsoft Clarity)
- Forms: Formspree with honeypot field (_gotcha)

## CSS Cache Busting
- All HTML links CSS with version param: /css/styles.css?v=1
- Increment version when CSS changes
- Rebuild all pages after CSS change: python3 scripts/build.py
