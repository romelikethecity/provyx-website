    <h2>Why Practice Size and Ownership Data Changes Your Sales Strategy</h2>
    <p>A solo family medicine practice and a 40-provider multi-specialty group both show up as "primary care" in a basic provider database. But they buy differently, budget differently, and make decisions through completely different processes. Selling the same way to both is a waste of your team's time and your prospect's patience.</p><p>The solo practitioner makes purchasing decisions over lunch. The group practice has a committee, an IT director, and a six-month evaluation cycle. A hospital-owned clinic has no local purchasing authority at all. A private equity-backed dental service organization might buy for 200 locations at once but route everything through a corporate procurement team in another state.</p><p>Without practice firmographic data, your team can't segment by practice size, can't prioritize by revenue potential, and can't adjust messaging for ownership type. You're forcing a one-size-fits-all approach on a market that's anything but uniform. According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, healthcare employs over 16 million people across dramatically different organizational structures, from single-provider offices to integrated health systems.</p>

    <h2>What's in a Practice Firmographic Record</h2>
    <div class="features-grid">

    <div class="feature-card">
      <div class="feature-icon"><i data-feather="users"></i></div>
      <h3>Provider Headcount Estimates</h3>
      <p>We estimate the number of licensed providers associated with each practice location using NPI affiliation data, web presence analysis, and commercial business databases. Headcount is broken into physicians, advanced practice providers (NPs and PAs), and total clinical staff where signals are available. This allows you to segment by practice size: solo, small group (2-5 providers), medium group (6-20), and large group (21+). Size segmentation is the single most predictive variable for deal size and sales cycle length.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <div class="feature-icon"><i data-feather="trending-up"></i></div>
      <h3>Revenue Range Modeling</h3>
      <p>We model annual revenue ranges for each practice using a combination of specialty, provider headcount, geographic cost-of-living adjustments, and payer mix indicators. Revenue estimates are expressed as ranges (e.g., $1M-$2.5M) rather than precise figures because practice revenue isn't publicly reported. The model is calibrated against known revenue data from practices that report financials through business credit agencies. Revenue estimates help you prioritize high-value targets and size your proposals appropriately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <div class="feature-icon"><i data-feather="clock"></i></div>
      <h3>Years in Business</h3>
      <p>We capture the original NPI enumeration date from <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/">NPPES records</a> and supplement it with state business registration dates to estimate how long a practice has been operating. Newer practices (under two years) have different technology needs, buying urgency, and budget constraints than established practices. A practice that's been open for six months is actively buying everything. A practice that's been running for 15 years has entrenched vendor relationships that are harder to displace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <div class="feature-icon"><i data-feather="briefcase"></i></div>
      <h3>Ownership Classification</h3>
      <p>We classify each practice into ownership categories: solo practitioner, independent group, hospital-owned or health system-affiliated, private equity-backed, dental service organization (DSO), management services organization (MSO), federally qualified health center (FQHC), or government-operated. Ownership type determines who makes purchasing decisions and how long that process takes. PE-backed practices and DSOs often centralize procurement, which means larger deals but longer cycles. Independent groups make decisions faster but buy for fewer locations.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <p class="addons-note"><strong>Add-ons:</strong> Enhanced firmographic data includes payer mix estimates (commercial vs Medicare vs Medicaid share), patient volume indicators, and practice growth trajectory based on headcount changes over time.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>How We Build Firmographic Profiles</h2>
    <p>Practice firmographic data is assembled from multiple sources because no single database captures all of it. NPI records provide the provider count and enumeration date. State business registrations provide incorporation date, registered agent, and sometimes ownership entity names. Commercial business credit databases contribute employee count ranges and revenue estimates. SEC filings and private equity deal announcements help us classify ownership type for PE-backed practices.</p><p>Revenue modeling uses a specialty-adjusted algorithm. A solo orthopedic surgeon generates significantly more revenue than a solo family medicine physician, and our model accounts for that. Geographic adjustments factor in regional reimbursement rates and cost-of-living differences. The model is validated quarterly against a holdout set of practices with known financials.</p><p>Ownership classification is the most labor-intensive field. We combine automated signals (web mentions of parent companies, PE portfolio listings) with manual research for ambiguous cases. DSO and MSO identification is particularly tricky because many operate under local brand names that don't reference the parent entity.</p>

    <h2>Who Uses Practice Firmographic Data</h2>
    <p><strong>Enterprise sales teams at health tech companies</strong> use firmographics to segment their total addressable market by practice size, revenue, and ownership type. This drives territory assignment, quota setting, and account prioritization. See our <a href="/for/health-tech-companies">health tech page</a> for more.</p><p><strong>Private equity firms and healthcare investors</strong> use firmographic data to identify acquisition targets, map competitive landscapes, and perform due diligence on platform investments. Knowing which practices in a market are independent vs already PE-owned shapes roll-up strategy.</p><p><strong>Group purchasing organizations</strong> use practice size and ownership data to identify potential members and estimate purchasing volume for contract negotiations.</p><p><strong>Healthcare consultants</strong> use firmographics to benchmark practices against peers of similar size, specialty, and ownership type. Revenue and headcount data enables apples-to-apples comparisons. Visit our <a href="/for/consulting-firms">consulting page</a> for details.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Data Quality and Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Firmographic data is inherently estimated. Unlike contact data, where a phone number is either right or wrong, a revenue estimate is a modeled range and a headcount is an approximation based on NPI affiliation signals.</p><p>Our provider headcount estimates are within one provider of the actual count for about 70% of practices, based on validation against practices that self-report size on their websites. Revenue ranges are calibrated to capture the actual figure within the stated range for approximately 65% of practices. Ownership classification accuracy exceeds 85% for the major categories (solo, group, hospital-owned). PE-backed and DSO classification is harder and sits around 75% accuracy. We update firmographic data quarterly.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>How do you estimate practice revenue when it's not publicly reported?</h3>
                <p>We use a specialty-adjusted model that factors in provider headcount, geographic reimbursement rates, payer mix indicators, and practice type. The model is calibrated against practices with known financials from business credit agencies. Revenue is expressed as a range rather than a point estimate to reflect the inherent uncertainty. The model performs best for single-specialty practices and less reliably for large multi-specialty groups.</p>
                <h3>Can you identify which practices are private equity-backed?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but with caveats. We identify PE-backed practices by tracking PE deal announcements, portfolio company listings, and parent entity ownership chains. Large platform acquisitions are well-documented and we capture those reliably. Smaller add-on acquisitions are harder to detect because they often aren't publicly announced. Our PE classification covers the majority of large PE-backed platforms in dental, dermatology, ophthalmology, and orthopedics.</p>
                <h3>What's the difference between a DSO and an MSO in your classification?</h3>
                <p>A dental service organization (DSO) typically owns the non-clinical assets and employs the administrative staff of dental practices. A management services organization (MSO) provides similar administrative services to medical practices. In our classification, DSO is used for dental-specific roll-ups and MSO for medical practice management entities. Both indicate centralized procurement and decision-making.</p>
                <h3>How often does ownership classification change?</h3>
                <p>Ownership changes happen constantly through acquisitions, mergers, and divestitures. We scan for ownership changes quarterly through PE deal monitoring, news alerts, and business registration updates. The pace of PE-backed consolidation in healthcare means that practices we classified as independent six months ago may now be part of a platform. Quarterly updates catch most transitions, but there's always a lag.</p>
