    <h2>Why Selling Into Healthcare Without Technology Data Is Guesswork</h2>
    <p>If you sell software or services to healthcare practices, the first question your sales team needs answered isn't "who's the decision-maker" or "what's their budget." It's "what are they currently using?" A practice running Epic isn't a prospect for your standalone EHR. A clinic that just signed a three-year contract with athenahealth isn't switching next quarter. But a practice still running an on-premise legacy system from a vendor that's been acquired twice? That's a live opportunity.</p><p>Without technology detection data, your team is cold-calling blind. They're pitching billing solutions to practices that already use the same platform. They're offering patient portal integrations to clinics whose EHR doesn't support them. They're wasting discovery calls on qualification questions that data could have answered before the dial.</p><p>The challenge is that healthcare practices don't publish their tech stacks. There's no central registry of which clinic uses which EHR. The <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/">ONC certified health IT product list</a> tells you what's certified, not what's installed. You need a different approach to get this data.</p>

    <h2>What Technology Data We Detect</h2>
    <div class="features-grid">

    <div class="feature-card">
      <div class="feature-icon"><i data-feather="monitor"></i></div>
      <h3>EHR System Identification</h3>
      <p>We identify the electronic health record system in use at each practice, covering major platforms like Epic, Cerner (now Oracle Health), athenahealth, eClinicalWorks, Greenway Health, NextGen, DrChrono, and dozens of smaller vendors. Our detection covers both cloud-hosted and on-premise deployments. For larger organizations with multiple EHR instances, we identify the primary system and note secondary or departmental systems where our signals are strong enough to confirm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <div class="feature-icon"><i data-feather="settings"></i></div>
      <h3>Practice Management Software Detection</h3>
      <p>Practice management software handles scheduling, registration, and administrative workflows. Many practices use a PM system from a different vendor than their EHR. We detect standalone PM platforms like Kareo, AdvancedMD, and CareCloud, as well as integrated EHR/PM suites. Knowing whether a practice uses an integrated or best-of-breed stack tells you a lot about their buying patterns and openness to new point solutions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <div class="feature-icon"><i data-feather="video"></i></div>
      <h3>Patient Engagement and Telehealth Platforms</h3>
      <p>We detect patient-facing technology including telehealth platforms (Doxy.me, Teladoc, Amwell), patient communication tools (Klara, Luma Health, Relatient), online scheduling platforms, and patient portal solutions. These signals are particularly valuable if you sell competing or complementary patient engagement tools. Post-pandemic telehealth adoption varies widely by specialty and practice size, and our detection data quantifies that adoption at the practice level.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <div class="feature-icon"><i data-feather="dollar-sign"></i></div>
      <h3>Billing and Revenue Cycle Management Systems</h3>
      <p>We identify billing software and revenue cycle management vendors including Waystar, Availity, Trizetto, Kareo Billing, and AdvancedMD Billing. We also flag practices that appear to use outsourced billing services based on web signals and job posting patterns. This data is valuable for RCM vendors, clearinghouse companies, and anyone selling into the financial operations side of healthcare practices.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>How We Detect Healthcare Technology Stacks</h2>
    <p>Technology detection in healthcare requires a fundamentally different approach than detecting website technologies like CMS platforms or analytics tools. Healthcare software often runs behind logins with no public-facing signals. Our methodology combines four signal sources.</p><p>First, we analyze practice websites for technology signatures: embedded widgets, patient portal links, booking platform integrations, and JavaScript references that identify specific vendor platforms. Second, we monitor healthcare job postings, which frequently name the EHR or PM system candidates will need experience with. Third, we track vendor directories, partner listings, and case studies published by technology companies that name their customers. Fourth, we incorporate ONC certified health IT data and state-level health information exchange participation records.</p><p>No single source covers every practice. The combination of all four gives us technology signals for the majority of practices with five or more providers. Each technology detection is linked to the practice's <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/">NPI record</a>, so you can cross-reference technology data with provider contact information and firmographics. Solo practices are harder to detect because they have smaller web footprints and fewer job postings.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Who Uses Technology Detection Data</h2>
    <p><strong>Healthcare software companies</strong> use technology detection to identify prospects running competing or complementary platforms. If you sell a patient intake solution that integrates with athenahealth but not Epic, you can target only athenahealth practices and skip the rest. That kind of precision transforms conversion rates. See our <a href="/for/health-tech-companies">health tech solutions</a>.</p><p><strong>EHR and PM vendors</strong> use competitive intelligence from technology detection to understand market share by region, specialty, and practice size. This informs product positioning, pricing strategy, and M&A decisions.</p><p><strong>Healthcare consultants and advisory firms</strong> use technology data to benchmark their clients against peers and identify modernization opportunities. When a practice is running outdated systems, consultants can quantify the gap.</p><p><strong>Investors evaluating healthcare IT companies</strong> use technology adoption data to validate vendor claims about market penetration and growth trajectory. When a vendor says they have 10,000 customers, technology detection data provides an independent check on that number.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Data Quality and Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Technology detection is inherently probabilistic. We're inferring technology usage from indirect signals, not reading it from a definitive registry. Our confidence levels reflect that reality.</p><p>For major EHR platforms at medium and large practices, our detection accuracy is above 80%. For niche PM tools at small practices, accuracy drops because the signals are weaker. Every technology detection record carries a confidence score: high (multiple independent signals), medium (single strong signal), or low (inferred from indirect evidence). We recommend filtering to medium and high confidence for outbound campaigns and using all confidence levels for market analysis. Technology data is refreshed on a quarterly cycle.</p>

If you need detection for a specific vendor not on our list, contact us and we can usually add it.</p>
                <h3>Can technology detection tell me when a contract is up for renewal?</h3>
                <p>Not directly. We don't have access to contract terms. However, we can provide estimated install date ranges based on when we first detected the technology at a given practice. If you know a vendor's typical contract length, you can estimate renewal windows from our install date signal. Our enhanced tier also includes technology change alerts that notify you when a practice switches.</p>
                <h3>Does technology detection work for solo practices?</h3>
                <p>Coverage is lower for solo practices because they generate fewer web signals and rarely post job listings that name their technology. Our detection rate for solo practices is roughly 40-50%, compared to 75-85% for group practices with five or more providers. We're transparent about this limitation because we'd rather you know the coverage rate upfront than discover gaps later.</p>
                <h3>How current is the technology detection data?</h3>
                <p>Technology data is refreshed quarterly. Healthcare practices don't switch EHR systems frequently. The average EHR contract runs three to seven years, so quarterly detection catches most transitions. For practices going through an active technology change, there may be a lag of one to two quarters before the new system appears in our data.</p>
