        <h2>Why Telehealth Provider Targeting Is Difficult</h2>
        
<p>
Telehealth moved from a niche offering to a standard care delivery model in a matter of months
during 2020, and the shift has proven permanent. The
<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/national-survey-trends-telehealth" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)</a>
found that telehealth utilization stabilized at levels far above pre-pandemic baselines.
Roughly 74% of practices now offer some form of video visit. For B2B companies selling
telehealth platforms, remote patient monitoring devices, digital health tools, or practice
management software, this creates a massive addressable market. The problem is identifying
which providers are actively delivering virtual care and at what scale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>No standard telehealth flag in NPI data.</strong> The
<a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS NPI Registry</a>
does not include a field indicating whether a provider offers telehealth. You cannot filter
NPPES for "telehealth providers." Taxonomy codes describe specialties, not delivery modalities.
Place-of-service code 02 (telehealth) appears on claims data, but that data is not linked to
provider directories in a way that is accessible to sales teams. There is no simple database
query that returns "all providers offering video visits."
</p>
<p>
<strong>Telehealth adoption varies widely.</strong> A dermatology practice in rural Texas offering
two video visits per week is very different from a telehealth-first behavioral health company
with 500 providers operating across 40 states. B2B sales teams need to distinguish between
occasional telehealth users and organizations built around virtual care. Most data sources
do not make this distinction. A practice that conducted one telehealth visit last quarter is
technically a "telehealth provider," but it is not a meaningful prospect for a telehealth
platform vendor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Provider addresses can be misleading.</strong> Telehealth-first organizations may list a
corporate headquarters or a registered agent address as their practice location. This makes
geographic targeting unreliable when using standard provider directories. A "New York"
telehealth company may have providers licensed in 30 states serving patients nationwide. A
therapist with a California NPI address may see patients in 15 states via PSYPACT or other
interstate compacts. Traditional geographic filtering breaks down for virtual care providers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The market changes rapidly.</strong> New telehealth companies launch, established
practices add or drop virtual visits, and state licensing regulations shift. A prospect list
built six months ago may be significantly outdated. The <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/ama-digital-health-care-2022-study-findings"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMA's physician practice benchmarks</a> show continued year-over-year
growth in telehealth adoption, meaning static snapshots miss new entrants constantly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fragmented competitive landscape.</strong> The telehealth vendor market itself is crowded,
with hundreds of platforms ranging from simple video tools to full virtual care operating
systems. Sellers need to understand not just whether a practice does telehealth, but what
tools they currently use and where gaps or dissatisfaction might exist. This competitive
intelligence layer is absent from every standard provider directory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Regulatory complexity across states.</strong> Telehealth regulations vary significantly
by state. Some states have adopted interstate compacts like the Interstate Medical Licensure
Compact (IMLC) for physicians or PSYPACT for psychologists, enabling cross-state practice.
Others maintain strict in-state licensing requirements. This regulatory patchwork means
that a telehealth provider's serviceable market depends on their license portfolio, not just
their physical location. Targeting telehealth providers without understanding their licensing
scope misses the geographic dimension of their practice entirely. A psychiatrist licensed in
12 states through IMLC operates a fundamentally different business than one licensed only in
their home state.

        <h2>How to Identify and Target Telehealth Providers</h2>
        
<p>
Targeting telehealth providers effectively requires combining multiple data signals rather than
relying on a single directory or flag. Provider data enriched with technology detection,
practice characteristics, and specialty filters gives sales teams the ability to build precise
telehealth prospect lists.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Technology stack detection.</strong> The most reliable signal for telehealth activity is
the technology a practice uses. Practices running Doxy.me, Amwell, Teladoc, or a telehealth
module within their EHR are actively delivering virtual care. Provyx's technology detection
data identifies the platforms installed at each practice location, allowing you to filter for
providers using specific telehealth tools or any telehealth platform. This signal is more
reliable than self-reported survey data because it reflects actual technology deployment, not
stated intentions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Specialty-based targeting.</strong> Telehealth adoption rates vary dramatically by specialty.
Behavioral health leads adoption, with psychiatry and therapy practices delivering 50% or more
of visits virtually in many markets. Primary care, endocrinology, and dermatology also have
high telehealth utilization. Surgical specialties and procedural fields have lower adoption
for obvious reasons. Filtering by taxonomy code and specialty lets you focus on the segments
where telehealth is most relevant to your product, avoiding wasted outreach to specialties
where virtual care plays a minimal role.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Organization type segmentation.</strong> The telehealth market includes several distinct
segments, each with different purchasing patterns and needs. Telehealth-first companies
(Teladoc, MDLive, Cerebral, Talkiatry) operate entirely or primarily via virtual care and
typically make centralized technology decisions. Hybrid practices blend in-person and virtual
visits and may be evaluating telehealth tools for the first time or looking to upgrade.
Health systems with enterprise telehealth programs make large-scale purchasing decisions through
IT governance processes. Individual providers using simple video tools (Zoom, FaceTime) represent
upgrade opportunities. Provider firmographic data, including organization size, multi-state
licensing, and practice type, lets you segment across these categories.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Multi-state licensing signals.</strong> Providers licensed in many states are more likely
to be part of telehealth-first or telehealth-heavy organizations. NPI data includes state
license information, and when a single provider or organization holds licenses in 10 or more
states, it is a strong indicator of a virtual care model. This signal is particularly useful
for identifying telehealth-first behavioral health providers and direct-to-consumer telehealth
companies that operate across state lines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Claims-based utilization indicators.</strong> Medicare claims data includes place-of-service
codes that identify telehealth encounters. While this data has a publication lag, it provides
a quantitative measure of telehealth utilization at the provider level. High telehealth claim
volumes confirm that a provider is not just equipped for virtual care but is actively
delivering it at scale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Practice website and digital presence analysis.</strong> Practices that prominently
advertise telehealth on their websites, offer online scheduling for virtual visits, or
maintain patient portals with video visit capabilities are signaling their commitment to
virtual care. Digital presence analysis supplements the other signals by identifying practices
that are actively marketing telehealth to patients, which indicates both current capability
and organizational investment in the modality.
</p>
<p>
Provyx combines these signals into actionable prospect lists. You define the specialty,
geography, organization type, and technology criteria, and receive a list of telehealth-active
providers with verified contact data, practice firmographics, and technology stack details.
The multi-signal approach produces more accurate identification than any single data source
can provide on its own, reducing both false positives (providers incorrectly identified as
telehealth-active) and false negatives (telehealth-active providers missed by a single signal).

        <h2>Results of Targeted Telehealth Prospecting</h2>
        
<p>
<strong>Higher relevance in outbound campaigns.</strong> Reaching out to practices that are already
using telehealth, or actively expanding their virtual care capabilities, produces better
response rates than blanketing an entire specialty. When your message references the prospect's
current telehealth setup, for example noting that they use Platform X and you integrate with
it or improve on it, it demonstrates research and relevance that generic outreach cannot match.
Sales teams using technology-informed targeting consistently report 2-4x improvements in email
open and reply rates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Faster disqualification of poor-fit prospects.</strong> Not every provider is a telehealth
prospect. Surgical practices, interventional radiology groups, and other procedure-heavy
specialties may have minimal telehealth activity. Providers who have invested heavily in a
competitor platform may not be ready to switch. Technology and specialty filters remove these
non-fits before they enter your pipeline, saving reps hours of wasted outreach per week and
improving pipeline quality metrics for sales managers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Competitive displacement opportunities.</strong> Knowing which telehealth platform a
practice currently uses creates natural competitive displacement campaigns. If you sell a
telehealth solution and can identify every practice running a competitor's platform, you have
a ready-made target list with a specific value proposition. This is far more effective than
generic messaging because the prospect already understands the category and has a basis for
comparison. Displacement campaigns targeting known users of specific competitors convert at
significantly higher rates than cold outreach.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Market sizing for new product launches.</strong> Companies entering the telehealth vendor
space need accurate market sizing. Provider data with telehealth signals lets you quantify
the addressable market by specialty, geography, and organization type, giving product and
strategy teams the numbers they need for launch planning. This same data informs pricing
models, channel strategy, and go-to-market prioritization.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Partnership and integration targeting.</strong> Telehealth platforms often integrate with
EHRs, practice management systems, and other clinical tools. Knowing both the telehealth
platform and the EHR at each practice enables partnership-driven selling: "We integrate with
your EHR and improve on your current telehealth tool." Technology stack data makes these
integration-based pitches possible at scale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Channel strategy optimization.</strong> Telehealth provider segments respond to different
sales channels. Telehealth-first companies with centralized purchasing require enterprise
field sales engagement. Mid-size hybrid practices respond well to inside sales and product
demos. Solo providers delivering occasional telehealth visits are best reached through
digital marketing, self-serve trials, and email campaigns. Technology and firmographic data
enables channel assignment at the segment level, ensuring each prospect enters the
appropriate sales motion rather than receiving a one-size-fits-all approach that mismatches
their buying behavior. This alignment between prospect characteristics and sales channel
is especially important in the telehealth market, where the range from solo therapist to
enterprise telehealth platform spans several orders of magnitude in deal size and complexity.
Getting the channel wrong wastes expensive field sales time on small deals or loses enterprise
opportunities to underpowered digital-only outreach.

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>How do you determine if a provider offers telehealth?</h3>
                <p>We use multiple signals: technology detection (identifying telehealth platforms installed at the practice), multi-state licensing patterns, specialty-based adoption rates, claims-based utilization data, and organizational attributes. No single signal is definitive, but combining them produces reliable telehealth identification with high accuracy.</p>
                <h3>Can I target providers using a specific telehealth platform?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Provyx's technology detection identifies specific telehealth platforms, EHR telehealth modules, and related digital health tools at the practice level. You can filter for providers using Doxy.me, Amwell, Zoom for Healthcare, or dozens of other platforms. This enables competitive displacement campaigns and integration-based messaging.</p>
                <h3>How large is the telehealth provider market?</h3>
                <p>According to HHS data, telehealth utilization has stabilized well above pre-pandemic levels. Roughly 74% of practices offer some telehealth. The addressable market depends on your product: telehealth-first organizations number in the hundreds, but hybrid practices offering virtual visits number in the hundreds of thousands across all specialties.</p>
                <h3>Does this include behavioral health telehealth providers?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Behavioral health is the highest-adoption specialty for telehealth, with many practices delivering the majority of their visits virtually.
