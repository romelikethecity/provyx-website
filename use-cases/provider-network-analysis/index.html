        <h1>Provider Network Analysis with Verified Practice Data</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Health plans, MSOs, and network developers need accurate provider data to assess network composition, identify gaps, and measure adequacy. Provyx provides the practice-level data that makes network analysis actionable.</p>
      </div>

    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why Provider Network Analysis Relies on Incomplete Data</h2>
        <p>Provider network analysis is supposed to answer straightforward questions: Do we have enough cardiologists in this market? Are our primary care locations accessible within 30 miles for 90% of members? Which specialties are underrepresented in our panel? The questions are simple. Getting reliable data to answer them is not.</p>

<p>Most network analysis starts with internal credentialing data, which reflects who's contracted but not necessarily who's still practicing at the address on file. Providers move, retire, change affiliations, and add or drop specialties. The <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS NPI Registry</a> is updated when providers re-enroll or revalidate, but those updates happen on varying schedules and many records go years between refreshes.</p>

<p>Health plans that rely solely on their own credentialing databases for network analysis often discover gaps too late. A provider listed as "in-network" at a specific address may have closed that practice location six months ago. The taxonomy codes in internal systems may not match the provider's actual practice focus. And new providers who've opened practices in underserved areas won't show up until they go through the contracting process, which can take months.</p>

<p>Regulatory requirements add urgency. CMS network adequacy standards, state Department of Insurance regulations, and NCQA accreditation all require health plans to demonstrate adequate provider access by specialty and geography. Submitting network adequacy reports built on stale data creates compliance risk.</p>

<p>The alternative is manually verifying every provider record against external sources, which is labor-intensive, slow, and still incomplete because you're checking one source at a time rather than cross-referencing multiple authoritative databases simultaneously.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section bg-light">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How Provyx Supports Provider Network Analysis</h2>
        <p>Provyx provides a verified external reference dataset that health plans and network organizations can use to validate, supplement, and benchmark their internal provider directories. Our data is sourced from the <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS NPI Registry</a>, business listings, and commercial databases, giving you a multi-source view of each provider's current status and location.</p>

<p>For network adequacy analysis, you can pull provider data by specialty and geography and compare it against your contracted panel. This identifies coverage gaps where you lack providers in a given specialty-geography combination, as well as opportunities where active providers in your market aren't yet in your network.</p>

<p>Every record includes NPI number, taxonomy codes (primary and secondary), verified practice address, business phone, and provider status. These fields map directly to the data points required for CMS network adequacy filings and state regulatory submissions. The address data is geocoded, which means you can run distance and drive-time analyses for member access calculations.</p>

<p>We also provide practice-level aggregation that shows which providers share a practice location, which helps you understand the difference between "number of providers" and "number of access points" in your analysis. A practice with five cardiologists at one address is different from five solo cardiologists spread across a metro area, and your network analysis should reflect that distinction.</p>

<p>The data is delivered in flat files that integrate with your network management tools, GIS mapping software, or internal analytics platforms. You can use it for one-time gap analysis or subscribe to regular refreshes that keep your external reference data current alongside your credentialing records.</p>

        <h2>What Better Provider Data Means for Network Analysis</h2>
        <p>Health plans and network organizations using external verified data for network analysis report fewer surprises during regulatory audits. When your provider directory is cross-referenced against current, multi-source data, the gaps you identify are real gaps rather than artifacts of stale internal records.</p>

<p>Network development teams also find new contracting targets faster. Instead of waiting for providers to approach them or relying on word-of-mouth referrals, they can see exactly which uncontracted providers are practicing in underserved areas and prioritize recruitment accordingly.</p>

<p>The operational benefit is reduced manual verification effort. Instead of having staff call individual practices to confirm addresses and active status, the external dataset provides a baseline that flags the records most likely to need attention. This lets your team focus verification efforts where they matter most.</p>

<p>For organizations preparing for mergers or market expansion, provider network data also reveals strategic partnership opportunities. Understanding which providers practice in your target area, their specialty mix, and which are unaffiliated helps network development teams prioritize recruitment outreach and identify potential anchor relationships for new service areas.</p>

                <h3>Can Provyx data support CMS network adequacy reporting?</h3>
                <p>Our data includes the fields typically required for network adequacy analysis: NPI number, taxonomy codes, verified practice address with geocoding, and provider type classification. We don't generate the regulatory filings themselves, but the underlying data supports the distance, provider count, and specialty coverage analyses that those filings require.</p>
                <h3>How do you handle providers who practice at multiple locations?</h3>
                <p>We track individual providers across their practice locations using NPI as the primary key. If a provider practices at three different addresses, each location appears as a separate record linked to the same NPI. This gives you an accurate picture of access points rather than just provider headcount.</p>
                <h3>Can I get provider data for a specific health plan service area?</h3>
                <p>Yes. You can define your service area by county, ZIP code, MSA, or custom geographic boundaries. We'll deliver all matching providers within that area, including those who may not be in your current network, so you can identify both your panel and the broader market.</p>
                <h3>How often should network analysis data be refreshed?</h3>
                <p>Most health plans refresh their external provider data quarterly to align with regulatory reporting cycles.
