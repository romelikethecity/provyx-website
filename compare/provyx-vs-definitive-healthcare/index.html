        <h1>Provyx vs. Definitive Healthcare</h1>

    </div>

<!-- Intro -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <p>Definitive Healthcare is the name that comes up most often when enterprise healthcare companies talk about commercial intelligence. It's a deep, well-established platform with data on hospitals, health systems, physician groups, and clinical affiliations. If you've been in healthcare sales or marketing for more than a few years, you've probably seen its reports or used its data.</p><p>This comparison is for teams that are evaluating Definitive Healthcare and wondering whether they need the full platform or whether a more targeted provider data solution would serve them better. That's a legitimate question, especially for mid-market companies, startups, and teams whose primary need is provider contact intelligence rather than hospital-level analytics.</p><p>We'll cover pricing, contract structures, data scope, and the practical differences in how each platform handles individual provider records. We'll also acknowledge where Definitive Healthcare has clear advantages, because there are real use cases where its depth and breadth are difficult to match. The goal is to help you figure out which platform fits your actual workflow, not to sell you on one over the other.</p><p>A quick caveat: Provyx does not compete with Definitive Healthcare across the board. If you need claims analytics, procedure volume estimates, or hospital referral network mapping, Definitive Healthcare does things Provyx simply does not do. This comparison focuses on the overlap: provider contact intelligence for sales and marketing teams. For that specific use case, the platforms diverge significantly in price, complexity, and approach.</p>

        <h2>Deep Dive: Definitive Healthcare</h2>
        <h3>What Definitive Healthcare Offers</h3><p><a href="https://www.definitivehc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Definitive Healthcare</a> is a healthcare commercial intelligence company that provides data, analytics, and insights on the entire healthcare ecosystem. Its platform covers hospitals, physician groups, ambulatory surgery centers, imaging centers, long-term care facilities, health systems, and individual providers. The company went public in 2021 and has since expanded its product suite through a series of acquisitions.</p><p>The platform is significantly more than a contact database. It includes claims-based analytics, referral network mapping, patient volume estimates, technology installation data, and competitive intelligence on which vendors hospitals are already using. For enterprise pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers with national sales forces, and healthcare IT companies selling to health systems, this breadth of intelligence is genuinely valuable.</p><p>Definitive Healthcare's data on hospitals and health systems is particularly strong. You can identify which facilities perform specific procedures, estimate their patient volumes for particular conditions, and map the physician referral relationships that drive volume to those facilities. This kind of analysis supports strategic territory planning, key account identification, and market sizing in ways that a simple contact list cannot.</p><p>The platform also includes data on healthcare executives, clinical leadership, and administrative contacts at institutional organizations. For selling to C-suite hospital administrators or department heads at large health systems, Definitive Healthcare provides organizational context that helps reps understand reporting structures and decision-making hierarchies.</p><p>Definitive Healthcare organizes its product into multiple modules. HospitalView covers acute care facilities. PhysicianView covers individual provider records. ClaimsMx provides claims-based analytics. Other modules cover long-term care, ambulatory surgery centers, imaging centers, and more. Most contracts involve access to specific modules rather than the entire platform, which means the data you can access depends on which modules your organization has purchased. This modular structure gives you flexibility to buy only what you need, but it also means that quoting a single price for "Definitive Healthcare" is misleading. Two companies can both be customers and have access to completely different datasets.</p><p>The company has also invested heavily in AI-driven analytics and predictive modeling. These features help enterprise teams identify which hospitals are most likely to adopt a new technology, predict patient volume trends, and model the impact of market shifts on specific facility types. For strategic planning at pharmaceutical and medical device companies with nine-figure revenue, these tools are genuinely differentiated. For a 20-person health-tech company that needs contact data for its first 500 outbound emails, they're academic.</p>
        <h3>Pricing and Contracts</h3><p>Definitive Healthcare does not publish pricing on its website. Based on publicly available information from user reviews, industry reports, and procurement databases, annual contracts typically range from $25,000 for a limited single-module license to well over $100,000 for multi-module enterprise access. Organizations with large sales teams or multiple departments accessing the platform can spend $200,000 or more annually.</p><p>Contracts are annual with auto-renewal clauses. Users report built-in annual price increases of approximately 5%, which are written into the contract terms at signing. If you sign at $50,000 in year one, you should expect to pay $52,500 in year two and $55,125 in year three without any expansion in usage.</p><p>One cost that catches teams off guard is the Salesforce integration add-on. Pushing Definitive Healthcare data directly into Salesforce, which is how most sales organizations actually want to use the data, requires a separate module that has been reported at $22,000 or more per year. That means the "real" starting price for a sales team that lives in Salesforce is closer to $47,000 than $25,000.</p><p>The platform's depth also creates a learning curve cost that doesn't show up on the invoice. Definitive Healthcare is a powerful analytics tool, and getting full value from it requires training, onboarding, and often a dedicated analyst or operations person to build and maintain the queries and exports your team needs. For a 10-person startup or a lean marketing team at a mid-market company, that operational overhead can be substantial.</p>
        <h3>Where Definitive Healthcare Falls Short for Provider Outreach</h3><p>Definitive Healthcare is excellent at what it was built for: institutional healthcare analytics. The gaps appear when you try to use it primarily as a provider contact intelligence tool for outbound sales and marketing.</p><p><strong>Individual provider data is not the primary focus.</strong> The platform's strength is hospital and health system data. Individual physician records exist, but they're often tied to organizational affiliations rather than mapped independently to practice locations. If you need to reach a specific orthopedic surgeon at their outpatient clinic rather than their hospital system's corporate office, Definitive Healthcare's data model sometimes makes that harder than it should be. According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, healthcare employs over 16 million people in the U.S., and the majority of those providers work in settings smaller than a hospital system.</p><p><strong>Pricing excludes smaller teams.</strong> A $25,000 to $100,000 annual commitment, plus integration costs, plus analyst time, means Definitive Healthcare is practically inaccessible to companies with annual marketing budgets under $200,000. That rules out most healthcare startups, many regional medical device distributors, and a large number of staffing firms and consulting practices that sell into healthcare every day.</p><p><strong>Getting data out of the platform is friction-heavy.</strong> Definitive Healthcare is designed to be used inside its own interface. Exporting data for use in your CRM, marketing automation tool, or custom analytics pipeline often requires the paid Salesforce connector or manual CSV exports with record limits. If your workflow is "give me a clean list of 2,000 providers meeting these criteria and let me load it into HubSpot," Definitive Healthcare adds steps that a simpler data delivery model eliminates.</p><p><strong>Steep learning curve absorbs productive hours.</strong> The platform's analytical depth is an asset for data analysts and market research teams. It's a liability for sales development reps who need a list by Thursday. Building effective queries in Definitive Healthcare takes training, and maintaining those queries as your targeting criteria evolve takes ongoing attention. Teams without a dedicated operations resource often end up using a fraction of the platform significantly, which makes the high annual cost even harder to justify.</p><p><strong>Overkill for contact-level outreach.</strong> If your primary use case is building targeted contact lists for email campaigns, phone outreach, or direct mail, you're paying for claims analytics, referral mapping, and market sizing capabilities you may never use. That's not a criticism of those features; they're valuable for the right buyer. But for teams whose daily workflow is "find providers, get their contact info, reach out," the platform's complexity works against them.</p><p><strong>Procurement timelines don't match sales urgency.</strong> Getting a Definitive Healthcare contract approved at most organizations involves procurement review, security assessment, budget approval, and sometimes legal review of the data usage terms. That process can take weeks or months. If your VP of Sales needs a provider list for a campaign launching next month, a multi-week procurement cycle for a six-figure platform isn't going to work. Faster, lighter alternatives exist for teams that need data on a shorter timeline.</p>

<!-- Deep Dive: Provyx -->

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Deep Dive: Provyx</h2>
        <h3>What Provyx Delivers</h3><p>Provyx is a healthcare provider business data platform focused on one thing: getting you accurate, contactable provider records for outbound sales and marketing. It doesn't try to be a market analytics platform. It doesn't include claims data or procedure volume estimates. What it does is give you clean, NPI-verified contact intelligence for the specific providers you want to reach.</p><p>The database covers physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, optometrists, chiropractors, physical therapists, behavioral health providers, and dozens of other licensed clinician types. Each record includes the provider's NPI number, taxonomy code, practice address (mapped to the location, not just the corporate entity), phone number, email address, and organizational affiliations.</p><p>Data is sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, state licensing boards, and commercial databases. The sourcing approach prioritizes accuracy for contact-level outreach rather than breadth of institutional analytics. If you need to know which hospital has the highest knee replacement volume in a metro area, Definitive Healthcare is the better tool. If you need the direct contact details for every orthopedic surgeon in that metro area, Provyx is built for that.</p><p>Provyx also doesn't try to be a market intelligence platform. That's a deliberate choice, not a gap. Claims analytics, procedure volume estimates, and predictive market models are valuable tools for the right buyer. But building those features into a contact data platform adds cost and complexity that gets passed on to every customer, including the ones who just need a clean list of providers to call. Provyx keeps the product focused so the pricing stays accessible to teams that don't need, and shouldn't pay for, enterprise analytics.</p><p>Speed of deployment is another practical difference. Provyx doesn't require a multi-week onboarding process, a dedicated analyst to build queries, or a training program to get your team productive. You define your target criteria, Provyx delivers the records, and your team starts outreach. For companies that are comparing a 6-week Definitive Healthcare implementation timeline against a same-week Provyx data delivery, the operational difference matters, especially when pipeline targets don't wait for procurement to finish.</p>
        <h3>How Provyx Handles Healthcare Provider Business Data</h3><p>The data model is NPI-first. Every record starts with a verified NPI number, and every attribute on that record, from specialty designation to practice address, is anchored to that identifier. This matters because it means you're not relying on job titles or self-reported profile information to determine whether someone is a practicing dermatologist or a retired administrator with "dermatology" in their LinkedIn headline.</p><p>Taxonomy code filtering gives you clinical specialty precision that job-title-based filtering simply can't match. The NUCC taxonomy system includes over 800 codes, and Provyx lets you filter by any combination of them. You can pull endocrinologists and internal medicine physicians in the same query, or narrow down to a single sub-specialty like pediatric hematology-oncology.</p><p>Practice-level mapping means you get the address and phone number for the location where a provider actually sees patients, not the billing address of their employer's parent company three states away. For field sales teams, territory managers, and regional marketers, this distinction directly affects whether your outreach lands or bounces.</p><p>Data delivery is straightforward. You define your criteria, Provyx builds the list, and you receive it as a CSV, through an API call, or pushed directly into Salesforce, HubSpot, or another CRM. There's no module to purchase, no connector fee, and no export limit to work around. The entire process, from defining your target audience to having records in your CRM, can happen in days rather than the weeks or months that enterprise platform procurement typically requires.</p>
        <h3>Pricing</h3><p>Provyx charges per record with volume-based discounts. There's no annual contract, no auto-renewal with built-in price increases, and no separate charge for CRM integration. You request the records you need, pay for those records, and receive them as a CSV, through an API, or pushed directly into your CRM.</p><p>There's no seat-based licensing. Five people on your team can use the same dataset without five separate platform licenses. There's no $22,000 add-on to get data into Salesforce. There's no training certification required to run a query.</p><p>For teams that have been quoted $50,000 to $100,000 for Definitive Healthcare and primarily need provider contact lists rather than market analytics, the cost difference is substantial. Many Provyx customers report spending 70% to 90% less than they were spending on enterprise healthcare data platforms, while achieving equal or better results on their provider outreach campaigns specifically.</p><p>Consider the total cost of ownership. With Definitive Healthcare, you're paying the license fee, the Salesforce integration add-on, the onboarding time, the ongoing training hours, and the analyst or operations person who maintains your queries. With Provyx, you're paying for the records. That's it. For a 50-person company with a 5-person sales team, the difference in total cost of ownership over three years can easily exceed $150,000.</p>

<h2>Who Should Choose What</h2>
<div class="scenario-list">
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need hospital-level analytics, claims data, and market sizing:</strong> Definitive Healthcare is the stronger platform. If your team includes market research analysts, strategic planning leaders, or enterprise sales reps who need to understand referral networks and procedure volumes before engaging an account, Definitive Healthcare's depth is worth the investment. Budget at least $50,000 annually once you include the Salesforce integration, and plan for a 2-4 week onboarding period to get full value from the platform. Assign a dedicated analyst or operations resource to own the platform and build queries for your team, because the ROI depends heavily on how well the tool is actually used.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need healthcare provider contact intelligence for outbound campaigns:</strong> Provyx delivers the specific data you need at a fraction of the cost. NPI-verified records, taxonomy code filtering, practice-level addresses, and flexible data delivery without a multi-month procurement process. If your team's daily work is building and executing outreach lists, not running market analytics, Provyx removes the complexity and cost that come with an enterprise analytics platform. You can go from "we need a list" to "we're running the campaign" in days, not months.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you have the budget for both and different teams with different needs:</strong> Using Definitive Healthcare for strategic market analysis and Provyx for tactical outreach list building is a combination that several organizations have adopted. Your market research team gets the depth they need for territory planning, and your sales and marketing teams get clean, actionable contact data without needing to learn a complex analytics platform. The total cost of this combination is often comparable to a fully loaded Definitive Healthcare enterprise license. The key is giving each team the tool that matches their actual workflow rather than forcing everyone onto a single platform that serves some teams well and others poorly.</p>
