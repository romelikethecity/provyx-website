        <p class="hero-subheadline">Lusha is a fast, affordable way to grab B2B contact data from LinkedIn. But healthcare provider outreach needs more than names and emails. Here's where these two platforms overlap and where they don't.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Intro -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <p>Lusha has built a strong reputation as a lightweight, easy-to-use B2B contact data platform. Its Chrome extension makes LinkedIn prospecting fast, its free tier gets teams started without budget approval, and its pricing stays accessible even on paid plans. If you sell software, consulting, or services to businesses across a range of industries, Lusha is a perfectly reasonable choice.</p><p>This comparison is for healthcare sales and marketing teams that are evaluating Lusha alongside Provyx, or that have already tried Lusha and found gaps in their provider outreach. We'll compare the two platforms on data depth, healthcare-specific capabilities, pricing, and the practical differences that show up when you're trying to reach physicians, nurse practitioners, and practice managers rather than VP-level buyers at SaaS companies.</p><p>All information here is based on publicly available product pages, <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/lusha/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G2 reviews</a>, Lusha's published pricing, and our own product documentation. Where we reference Provyx capabilities, those are based on data sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases.</p><p>We'll also be direct about where Lusha wins. If your prospecting extends well beyond healthcare, or if your primary workflow is Chrome-based LinkedIn outreach across multiple industries, Lusha may genuinely be the better fit. Not every team needs a healthcare-specific data vendor, and we'd rather help you make that call quickly than waste your time.</p>

<!-- Deep Dive: Competitor -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Deep Dive: Lusha</h2>
        <h3>What Lusha Offers</h3><p><a href="https://www.lusha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lusha</a> is an Israeli-founded B2B contact and company data platform that focuses on making it easy to find verified email addresses and direct-dial phone numbers for business professionals. The company reports roughly 100 million business profiles in its database, spanning a wide range of industries. Its sweet spot is sales teams that need a fast, affordable way to enrich LinkedIn profiles with contact details they can actually use for outreach.</p><p>The platform's signature feature is its Chrome extension. When you visit a LinkedIn profile, the extension surfaces the contact's email address, phone number, company details, and job title in a sidebar. For sales reps who spend their prospecting hours on LinkedIn, this workflow is genuinely efficient. You find someone, you get their contact info, and you add them to your CRM or outreach sequence in seconds. The friction is minimal, and the time-to-first-touch is very fast compared to traditional data platforms that require logging into a separate tool.</p><p>Beyond the extension, Lusha offers a web-based prospecting tool where you can search and filter contacts by job title, industry, company size, location, and other standard B2B firmographic attributes. There's also a Salesforce and HubSpot integration for syncing enriched contacts directly into your CRM. The platform includes basic list management features and data enrichment APIs for teams that want to clean or append contact data programmatically.</p><p>Lusha's data is sourced through a combination of its community contributor network, public data sources, and data partnerships. The community model works similarly to other platforms: users who install Lusha's extension contribute anonymized contact data from their professional networks, and in return they get credits or enhanced access. Lusha is GDPR-compliant and holds ISO 27701 certification, which signals that the company takes data privacy seriously. For industries where GDPR compliance matters (particularly European markets), that certification is a meaningful differentiator from some competitors.</p><p>The platform's strengths are clear: it's fast, it's cheap, and the Chrome extension workflow is one of the best in the market for LinkedIn-based prospecting. Lusha's G2 rating sits at approximately 4.3 out of 5 with over 1,400 reviews, and the positive feedback consistently mentions ease of use, accurate direct dials, and responsive customer support.</p><p>Where Lusha was designed to excel is in helping sales development reps at tech companies, agencies, and professional services firms find and contact their prospects quickly. It's a lightweight, focused tool that does one thing well: turning LinkedIn profiles into actionable contact records. For that specific job, it performs.</p><p>The negative reviews tend to mention credit limitations, occasional data gaps for smaller companies, and a database that's smaller than enterprise-grade alternatives like ZoomInfo. For teams that need deep account intelligence, intent data, or coverage of niche industries, Lusha's breadth and depth can feel limited. Those aren't bugs in the product. They're boundaries of a tool that was built to be accessible and efficient, not comprehensive.</p>
        <h3>Pricing and Contracts</h3><p>Lusha's pricing is published and straightforward, which is a genuine advantage over competitors that require a demo call to get a quote. There are four tiers. The Free plan gives each user 5 credits per month, enough to test the platform but not enough to sustain any real prospecting volume. The Pro plan at $36 per user per month (billed annually) provides 480 credits per year and adds list management and basic enrichment features. The Premium plan at $59 per user per month (billed annually) increases the credit allotment and adds bulk enrichment. The Scale plan is custom-priced for enterprise teams with higher volume needs.</p><p>Credits are consumed when you reveal a contact's information. One credit unlocks one phone number, and one credit unlocks one email address. If you need both an email and a phone number for the same contact, that's two credits. For teams running high-volume outbound, credits can deplete faster than expected, particularly if you're building initial prospect lists for a new territory or campaign.</p><p>Compared to enterprise data platforms, Lusha's pricing is genuinely low. A single Pro user at $36 per month costs less than most teams spend on coffee. The annual commitment on paid plans is standard in the industry, and the month-to-month option (at a higher rate) gives you flexibility if you're not ready to commit.</p><p>The cost question for healthcare teams isn't whether Lusha is affordable in absolute terms. It clearly is. The question is whether the data you get for those credits is useful enough to drive healthcare provider outreach. If half your Lusha credits return contacts you can't verify as active providers, or contacts whose specialty and practice location you can't confirm, then the effective cost per qualified healthcare contact is higher than the sticker price suggests. A $36 monthly tool that gives you contacts you have to manually verify against the NPI Registry before using them isn't actually saving you money once you account for the labor.</p>
        <h3>Where Lusha Falls Short for Healthcare Teams</h3><p>Lusha wasn't designed for healthcare. That's not a criticism of the product. It's a description of the product. The gaps healthcare teams encounter aren't defects; they're features that were never in scope for a general-purpose B2B contact tool. But if you're selling into healthcare providers, those gaps are the difference between productive outreach and wasted hours.</p><p><strong>No NPI data at all.</strong> Lusha doesn't include National Provider Identifier numbers in its records, and it doesn't verify contacts against the <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS NPI Registry</a>. That means you can't confirm whether a contact is an active, licensed healthcare provider. A "Doctor" on LinkedIn could be a practicing cardiologist, a retired dermatologist, a PhD researcher, or someone who just lists "Dr." as a courtesy title. Without NPI verification, you're guessing.</p><p><strong>No taxonomy code filtering.</strong> The NUCC taxonomy system classifies healthcare providers into over 800 specialty codes. If you need to reach interventional cardiologists in Texas, or pediatric nurse practitioners in the Mid-Atlantic, taxonomy codes are how you do that with precision. Lusha's filters work on job titles, industries, and company attributes, which are useful for general B2B work but too imprecise for clinical specialty targeting. Job title searches for "cardiologist" will miss providers who list themselves as "interventional specialist" and will include cardiac rehab coordinators who aren't physicians.</p><p><strong>Shallow healthcare coverage.</strong> Lusha's 100 million profiles span every industry. Healthcare providers make up a fraction of that total, and the providers who are included tend to be executives and administrators at large hospital systems, not individual physicians in private practice. If you're trying to reach the orthopedic surgeon who owns a three-location practice in suburban Atlanta, or the family medicine physician running a rural clinic in Montana, Lusha probably doesn't have a verified record for them. The platform's data collection methods (community contributions, LinkedIn enrichment) work best for professionals who are digitally active on business networks. Many physicians simply aren't.</p><p><strong>No practice-level location data.</strong> Lusha associates contacts with company records, and the addresses attached to those records are typically corporate headquarters or the primary office listed on the company's website. For healthcare, that's often a hospital system's administrative building, not the clinic where a provider sees patients. If your field reps need to know which specific office to visit, or your direct mail campaign needs the right practice address, Lusha's location data won't get you there.</p><p><strong>Chrome-first workflow doesn't fit healthcare prospecting.</strong> Lusha's Chrome extension is genuinely great for LinkedIn-based prospecting. The problem is that many healthcare providers don't maintain active LinkedIn profiles. Physicians, in particular, are among the least active professional groups on LinkedIn. If your prospecting workflow depends on finding targets on LinkedIn and then enriching them, you're starting with a pool that excludes a large portion of the healthcare providers you need to reach. The platform works best when your targets live on LinkedIn. Healthcare providers, largely, do not.</p>

<!-- Deep Dive: Provyx -->

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Deep Dive: Provyx</h2>
        <h3>What Provyx Delivers</h3><p>Provyx is a healthcare provider business data platform. Every record in the database represents a healthcare provider or practice location, verified against the National Provider Identifier Registry maintained by CMS. There's no cross-industry data, no Chrome extension for LinkedIn, and no built-in email sequencing. Provyx does one thing: it delivers accurate, targetable healthcare provider contact intelligence.</p><p>The database covers physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, optometrists, chiropractors, physical therapists, behavioral health providers, and other licensed clinicians across the United States. Records include NPI numbers, NUCC taxonomy codes, practice addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and affiliated organizations.</p><p>Data is sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, state licensing boards, and commercial databases. Provyx doesn't rely on crowdsourced community data or LinkedIn profile scraping. The sourcing methodology was built for a market where provider credentials matter and where the people you're trying to reach often don't have a digital footprint on business social networks.</p><p>Provyx doesn't try to compete with Lusha on general B2B prospecting. If you need to find the VP of Engineering at a Series B SaaS company, Provyx isn't the tool. But if you need to find every endocrinologist within 50 miles of a target ZIP code, with verified contact details and practice-level addresses, that's the entire point of the platform.</p>
        <h3>How Provyx Handles Healthcare Provider Business Data</h3><p>NPI verification is the foundation of every record in Provyx. Each contact is matched against the CMS NPI Registry, which confirms that the provider holds a valid national identifier and is a real, identifiable healthcare professional. This eliminates a class of problems that general platforms can't solve: Is this contact actually a physician? Are they still practicing? What's their real clinical specialty? The NPI record answers all three.</p><p>Taxonomy code filtering gives you clinical specialty precision that job title searches can't match. There are over 800 NUCC taxonomy codes covering everything from general internal medicine to pediatric interventional cardiology. You can filter by single codes or combine them to build highly targeted lists. Need every orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine physician within 75 miles of a distribution center? That's a two-code filter with a geographic radius. With Lusha, you'd be searching for variations of job titles and hoping the results are accurate.</p><p>Practice-level location data maps providers to the specific clinics, offices, and facilities where they see patients. A physician who works at a hospital system and also runs a private practice appears with both locations and separate contact details for each. This is critical for field sales teams, territory planning, and direct mail campaigns that need to reach the right physical address, not just a hospital system's administrative headquarters.</p><p>Data transparency is built into the sourcing model. Every record traces back to a public NPI registry entry, a state licensing board record, or a verified business listing. If your compliance team asks where the data came from, the answer is straightforward and auditable. In healthcare, that clarity matters. Compliance teams at medical device companies and pharmaceutical firms often need to document data provenance before approving outreach campaigns. Provyx makes that documentation simple.</p><p>Geographic filtering works at the ZIP code, city, county, state, and custom radius level. Combined with taxonomy codes, this lets you build the exact list you need: every gastroenterologist in the Denver metro, every psychiatrist in rural Appalachian counties, every family medicine physician within 20 miles of your new satellite office. The specificity isn't a nice-to-have. For healthcare sales teams, it's the difference between a campaign that generates qualified meetings and one that generates unsubscribes.</p>
        <h3>Pricing</h3><p>Provyx uses a pay-per-record model. You buy the records you need, when you need them. There's no monthly subscription, no annual contract, no auto-renewal, and no credit system that forces you to use or lose a set number of reveals each month. If you need 300 records for a regional device launch, you pay for 300 records. If you need 20,000 for a national campaign, the per-record price drops with volume.</p><p>There are no seat-based licenses. Your entire team, from the SDR to the VP of Sales, can access and use the records you've purchased. Data is delivered as CSV, through an API, or pushed directly into your CRM. Once you've bought the records, they're yours.</p><p>Provyx doesn't have a free tier, and it's not trying to compete on price per credit with Lusha's $36 per month Pro plan. The value proposition is different. Lusha gives you affordable access to general B2B contacts. Provyx gives you verified healthcare provider records with NPI numbers, taxonomy codes, and practice-level addresses included in every record. You're comparing the cost of a general contact you still need to verify against the cost of a record that arrives verified.</p><p>For healthcare teams, the math matters at the campaign level. A pharma field team that needs to visit every rheumatologist in a five-state territory can buy exactly those records, with confirmed practice addresses, and know the total cost before they start. With Lusha, the same team would spend credits on LinkedIn-sourced contacts that may or may not be rheumatologists, may or may not have accurate addresses, and will almost certainly require manual cleanup before the field team can use them. The per-credit cost is low, but the per-usable-record cost is often higher than it appears.</p>

<h2>Who Should Choose What</h2>
<div class="scenario-list">
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need affordable general B2B prospecting data:</strong> Lusha is a solid choice. Its Chrome extension is one of the best tools available for LinkedIn-based prospecting, the free tier lets you test before committing, and the paid plans are priced for individual reps and small teams, not enterprise procurement cycles. If your targets are tech executives, agency decision-makers, professional services buyers, or anyone who actively maintains a LinkedIn presence, Lusha will get you verified emails and direct dials quickly. It's particularly good for SDRs who live in their browser and want contact data without leaving LinkedIn. Just don't expect it to cover niche verticals with the same depth as specialized tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need healthcare provider contact intelligence:</strong> Provyx was built for this. You'll get NPI-verified records, taxonomy code filtering across 800+ specialties, and practice-level addresses that map providers to the specific clinics where they see patients. Every record arrives with the identifiers healthcare sales teams actually need: NPI numbers, specialty codes, and verified contact details sourced from public registries and commercial databases. The pay-per-record model means you're buying exactly the records your campaign requires, with no monthly credit pressure. If 100% of your pipeline comes from healthcare providers, a specialized data platform will outperform a general tool on every metric that matters: targeting precision, contact accuracy, and cost per qualified record.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If budget is tight and you need both:</strong> Lusha for your non-healthcare prospecting and Provyx for healthcare provider campaigns is a practical split. Lusha's Pro plan at $36 per month keeps your general outreach affordable, and Provyx's pay-per-record model means you only pay for healthcare data when you have a specific campaign to run. The two tools don't overlap much: Lusha's strength is LinkedIn enrichment across general industries, and Provyx's strength is verified healthcare provider records with clinical identifiers. Used together, the combined cost is a fraction of an enterprise data platform subscription, and you'll get better healthcare data than any general tool can deliver on its own.</p>
