<!-- Intro -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <p>If you're evaluating healthcare provider databases, IQVIA's OneKey product (formerly SK&amp;A) has probably come up in your research. It's one of the most recognized names in healthcare data, period. But recognition and fit aren't the same thing, and a lot of teams end up paying enterprise prices for capabilities they'll never touch.</p><p>This comparison is for healthcare marketing agencies, medical device sales teams, pharma commercial organizations, and healthcare SaaS vendors who need accurate provider contact data: NPI numbers, emails, phone numbers, and practice addresses. If you want to understand whether IQVIA OneKey or Provyx is the better match for that specific job, this page lays out the differences in plain terms.</p><p>We'll cover what each platform actually offers, how pricing works, where each one falls short, and which scenarios favor which tool. We source our IQVIA information from their public website, G2 reviews, published industry reports, and documented customer feedback. Provyx information comes from our own platform and pricing.</p><p>Full disclosure: we built Provyx, so we obviously have a perspective here. We've tried to keep this honest. Where IQVIA is the better choice, we'll say so. There are real scenarios where IQVIA's depth and breadth are exactly what a team needs, and we'll call those out clearly throughout this comparison.</p>

        <h2>Deep Dive: IQVIA OneKey</h2>
        <h3>What IQVIA OneKey Offers</h3><p>IQVIA is not a simple data vendor. It's a $15 billion healthcare data and analytics company formed from the 2016 merger of IMS Health and Quintiles. Their product suite spans clinical trial management, real-world evidence, commercial analytics, and technology platforms that serve the largest pharma and life sciences organizations in the world. OneKey is one piece of that ecosystem, but it's deeply embedded in it.</p><p>OneKey, which IQVIA acquired when it was known as SK&amp;A, is a healthcare professional (HCP) and healthcare organization (HCO) reference database. According to <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/solutions/commercialization/brand-strategy-and-management/onekey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IQVIA's website</a>, OneKey covers approximately 9 million healthcare professionals globally across more than 80 countries. That global footprint is a genuine differentiator. If your sales team operates across the EU, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, very few databases can match that reach.</p><p>The core of OneKey is provider identity resolution. IQVIA assigns each healthcare professional a unique identifier and links that professional to their organizational affiliations, specialties, and geographic locations. For pharma companies running multi-channel commercial campaigns, this identity layer matters because it connects prescribing behavior to individual providers. When your field reps visit a physician, your digital team emails that same physician, and your managed markets team engages the health system where they practice, the OneKey ID ties all of those interactions to a single profile. That's harder to replicate than it sounds.</p><p>And that's where IQVIA's real strength lives: prescribing data. Through their proprietary data assets, IQVIA can tell you which physicians are writing scripts for specific drug classes, how prescribing volumes trend over time, and how your product stacks up against competitors at the individual prescriber level. No other vendor offers this at IQVIA's scale. It's the reason large pharma companies pay what they pay. For a brand manager at a top-20 pharma company, knowing that Dr. Smith wrote 47 prescriptions for a competing drug last quarter is the kind of intelligence that directly shapes territory strategy and call planning.</p><p>IQVIA's data sourcing is also distinct from most competitors. They combine proprietary physician surveys, pharmacy claims data, hospital discharge records, and commercial databases to build their provider profiles. This multi-source approach gives them data points that public registries simply don't contain, particularly around prescribing behavior, patient panel size estimates, and clinical activity indicators. The tradeoff is that this proprietary sourcing makes it harder for customers to independently verify the underlying data.</p><p>Beyond OneKey, IQVIA offers analytics platforms, real-world evidence studies, clinical trial design and recruitment, and consulting services. Their technology stack includes the Orchestrated Customer Engagement (OCE) platform for commercial teams, which integrates CRM functionality with their data assets. For a large pharma commercial organization, this integration between data, analytics, and execution tools can be genuinely valuable. You're not just buying a database; you're buying into an ecosystem where your CRM, your analytics dashboards, and your provider data all speak the same language.</p><p>IQVIA also maintains strong compliance frameworks. They're experienced in navigating healthcare data regulations across multiple jurisdictions, including GDPR in Europe and various state-level privacy laws in the U.S. For enterprise buyers with legal teams that scrutinize every vendor, IQVIA's compliance posture is a meaningful advantage. They've been through thousands of enterprise procurement reviews, and their security documentation and data processing agreements reflect that experience.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/iqvia-onekey/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G2</a>, OneKey holds approximately a 4.0 rating. Reviewers frequently praise the depth of data and the global coverage. The most common complaints center on platform complexity, long onboarding timelines, and cost. Several reviewers note that getting value from IQVIA requires dedicated internal resources to manage the relationship and the platform. One recurring theme in reviews: the data is excellent for analytics and segmentation, but extracting simple contact lists for outreach campaigns can feel like using a sledgehammer for a thumbtack.</p><p>It's worth being clear about what OneKey is not: it's not a quick-start contact database. You don't sign up on Tuesday and pull a list on Wednesday. Implementation timelines for new IQVIA customers can stretch weeks or months, depending on the scope of data access, integration requirements, and internal approval processes. That's standard for enterprise data platforms, but it's a real factor for teams that need data quickly. If you have a campaign launching in three weeks and don't already have an IQVIA contract in place, you're unlikely to have data in hand by launch day.</p>
        <h3>Pricing and Contracts</h3><p>IQVIA does not publish pricing for OneKey or any of its other products. This is standard practice for enterprise data vendors that customize pricing based on data volume, geographic scope, use case, and contract length. You won't find a pricing page on iqvia.com. The process starts with a sales conversation, typically followed by a needs assessment, a custom proposal, and procurement review.</p><p>Based on industry reports, published case studies, and feedback from teams who've gone through the procurement process, OneKey contracts typically start in the $50,000 to $200,000+ per year range. The exact figure depends on how many data fields you need access to, how many markets you're covering, whether you're licensing prescribing data alongside the contact records, and whether you're also using IQVIA's analytics or CRM platforms. Teams that bundle multiple IQVIA products often land at the higher end of that range, sometimes significantly above it.</p><p>Contracts are annual, and multi-year commitments are common. Some customers report that IQVIA offers better per-record pricing on multi-year deals, but that also means you're locked in for 24 to 36 months. Exiting early typically isn't an option without paying out the remainder of the contract. For teams whose data needs might shift, or companies that are still figuring out their commercial model, that's a substantial bet.</p><p>Implementation costs can add to the total. If you need custom integrations with your existing CRM or data warehouse, expect professional services fees on top of the license. Several G2 reviewers mention that the total cost of ownership exceeded their initial expectations once implementation, training, and ongoing support were factored in. One reviewer noted that the integration with their Salesforce instance alone took several weeks and required both internal IT resources and IQVIA professional services.</p><p>For a large pharma commercial team with a seven-figure data budget, this pricing can be justified by the prescribing analytics alone. The ROI calculation is straightforward when prescribing data directly informs territory optimization and call planning for a billion-dollar drug. For a 15-person medical device sales team or a healthcare marketing agency with 20 clients, the math often doesn't work. You end up paying for global coverage when you only sell in the U.S., prescribing analytics when you're selling devices not drugs, and platform complexity when you just need a clean CSV.</p>
        <h3>Where IQVIA Falls Short for Provider Contact Data Buyers</h3><p><strong>You're paying for capabilities you won't use.</strong> IQVIA's pricing reflects the full breadth of their data and analytics ecosystem. If all you need is NPI-verified contact information for healthcare providers in a specific specialty and geography, you're effectively subsidizing prescribing analytics, global HCP coverage, and clinical trial infrastructure you'll never touch. That overhead shows up in your invoice. A healthcare marketing agency that needs 5,000 dermatologist emails in California shouldn't need to pay the same rate as a pharma company analyzing national prescribing trends.</p><p><strong>Implementation timelines aren't built for speed.</strong> Multiple G2 reviewers describe onboarding processes that took weeks or longer. Enterprise procurement, legal review, data access provisioning, and platform training all add up. If your team needs provider records for a campaign launching next month, IQVIA's timeline may not align with yours. For agencies that serve multiple healthcare clients with different timelines, the lag between signing a contract and pulling your first record can be a real operational problem.</p><p><strong>The platform assumes enterprise-level resources.</strong> Getting full value from IQVIA often requires a dedicated team or at least a point person who understands the platform, manages the vendor relationship, and translates the data into actionable outputs for sales and marketing. Smaller teams frequently report feeling overwhelmed by the platform's complexity, according to G2 reviews. If your company has 50 employees and no data ops function, you may find yourself paying for a platform that sits underutilized because nobody has time to learn it properly.</p><p><strong>Annual contracts create budget inflexibility.</strong> If your data needs are seasonal or project-based, a $50,000+ annual commitment creates waste. You can't scale down during slow quarters or pause your subscription between campaigns. The contract runs regardless of how much data you pull. Medical device companies launching in a new territory might need heavy data pulls for three months and then very little for the rest of the year. Under an annual license, you're paying the same rate in month ten as you did in month one.</p><p><strong>U.S. provider contact accuracy can vary at the practice level.</strong> IQVIA's global strength is in identity resolution and prescribing data, not necessarily in maintaining the freshest email addresses and direct phone numbers for U.S. providers at individual practice locations. Some users on G2 have noted that contact-level data (emails, phone numbers) required supplementation from other sources, even within an active OneKey license. This makes sense when you consider that IQVIA's data sourcing is optimized for analytics and prescribing intelligence, not for maintaining real-time contact accuracy at the practice level. If your primary use case is email outreach or phone-based sales, the contact fields may not be as reliable as you'd expect given the price tag.</p><p><strong>The sales process itself can be a barrier.</strong> Getting a quote from IQVIA isn't a self-service experience. You'll go through multiple sales calls, a needs assessment, and potentially a proof-of-concept before you see final pricing. For teams that already know exactly what they need (provider contacts filtered by specialty and geography), this process adds time without adding clarity. Some buyers report that the entire procurement cycle, from first call to signed contract, takes two to three months.</p>

        <h2>Deep Dive: Provyx</h2>
        <h3>What Provyx Delivers</h3><p>Provyx is a healthcare provider business data vendor. We sell verified contact records for healthcare providers in the United States: NPI numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, practice addresses, and organizational affiliations. Our data is sourced from the public CMS NPI Registry, business listings, and commercial databases, then verified and enriched before delivery.</p><p>Every record in Provyx is matched against the <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS NPI Registry</a> to confirm that the provider holds an active NPI and that their taxonomy classification is current. You can filter by any of the 800+ NUCC taxonomy codes, which means you can pull records for pediatric cardiologists in Texas or orthopedic surgeons within 50 miles of Chicago without wading through irrelevant specialties.</p><p>Data delivery is straightforward. You can download records as CSV files, connect through our API for automated pulls, or push records directly into your CRM. There's no platform to learn, no implementation timeline, and no professional services engagement required. Most customers go from signup to first data pull in under an hour. For teams that have been through a months-long enterprise data procurement process before, this is often the thing they comment on first.</p><p>The records themselves include the fields that sales and marketing teams actually use day to day: provider name, NPI number, primary and secondary taxonomy codes, practice name, practice address, email, phone, and fax. We don't pad records with dozens of fields that look impressive on a spec sheet but sit unused in your CRM. Every field we deliver has a clear use case in outreach, segmentation, or territory planning.</p><p>We should be upfront about what Provyx does not offer. We don't have prescribing data. We don't offer claims analytics, clinical trial services, or real-world evidence platforms. We don't cover providers outside the United States. We're not trying to be an all-in-one healthcare intelligence platform. If those capabilities are requirements for your team, Provyx isn't the right fit, and IQVIA likely is.</p>
        <h3>How Provyx Handles Healthcare Provider Business Data</h3><p>Healthcare provider business data has specific requirements that general-purpose B2B data tools weren't built to handle. NPI numbers are the universal identifier in U.S. healthcare, and any provider database that doesn't verify against the CMS NPI Registry is guessing. Provyx treats NPI verification as foundational, not optional. Every record we deliver has been checked against the <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS NPI Registry</a> to confirm the NPI is active and the associated taxonomy codes are current.</p><p>Taxonomy codes are another area where healthcare-specific tooling matters. The National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC) maintains over 800 taxonomy codes that classify healthcare providers by specialty, sub-specialty, and provider type. A general B2B data vendor might give you "physician" as a category. Provyx lets you filter down to specific taxonomy codes like 207RC0000X (cardiovascular disease) or 2084P0800X (psychiatry) so your outreach actually reaches the right providers. If you're a medical device company that sells to interventional cardiologists specifically, the difference between "cardiologist" and the correct sub-specialty taxonomy code is the difference between a qualified lead and a wasted touchpoint.</p><p>Practice-level location data matters too. Many providers practice at multiple locations, and the address attached to their NPI registration may not be the best address for sales outreach. A surgeon's NPI might list their hospital system's administrative office, but your rep needs the ambulatory surgery center where they actually operate three days a week. Provyx maps providers to their practice locations using business listing data and commercial databases, giving you the practice address where they actually see patients, not just their billing address.</p><p>For healthcare marketing agencies running campaigns across multiple specialties and geographies, this granularity is the difference between relevant outreach and spray-and-pray. For medical device reps who need to identify orthopedic surgeons at ambulatory surgery centers within their territory, it's the difference between a productive week and a wasted one. And for healthcare SaaS vendors trying to reach practice managers and group practice decision-makers, taxonomy and location filtering lets you target the right practice types without manually sorting through thousands of irrelevant records.</p><p>We also recognize that healthcare data carries regulatory considerations. While Provyx deals exclusively in business contact data (not patient health information), we maintain clear data sourcing documentation and processing standards. Every record traces back to public registries, business listings, or commercial data sources. We don't scrape social media, and we don't use patient encounter data to enrich provider records. When your compliance team asks where the data comes from, you get a clear answer.</p><p>This focus on transparency is deliberate. In healthcare, the question "where did this data come from?" matters more than in most industries. Your legal team will ask. Your compliance officer will ask. If you're marketing to providers on behalf of pharma clients, their compliance teams will ask too. Provyx's sourcing model is designed to make that question easy to answer: public registries, business listings, and commercial databases, verified and enriched, with no patient data involved at any stage.</p>
        <h3>Pricing</h3><p>Provyx uses pay-per-record pricing. You pay for the records you pull, and that's it. There are no annual contracts, no seat licenses, no minimum commitments, and no implementation fees. You sign up, filter the providers you need by taxonomy code and geography, and pull records. Your cost scales directly with your usage.</p><p>This model exists because we've talked to enough healthcare marketing agencies and medical device sales teams to know that data needs aren't static. You might need 5,000 cardiologist records for a Q1 campaign, then nothing for two months, then 2,000 oncologist records for a product launch. Paying $50,000+ per year for a database you use intermittently doesn't make financial sense for most teams outside of large pharma. With Provyx, your data spend maps to your actual data consumption. Slow month? You spend less. Big launch? You pull more records and pay accordingly.</p><p>Volume pricing is available. The more records you pull, the lower your per-record cost. But even at small volumes, you're spending a fraction of what an IQVIA OneKey license would cost. For a team that needs 10,000 provider records per year, the difference between Provyx and an enterprise data platform can be tens of thousands of dollars. For a healthcare marketing agency that serves multiple clients across different specialties, the savings are often enough to fund an additional headcount or campaign.</p><p>There are no seats to manage, either. Your entire team can access Provyx under one account. We don't charge per user because the number of people on your team who need to pull data has nothing to do with how much data you're actually using. Seat-based pricing is a vendor convenience, not a customer benefit.</p><p>You can see current pricing on our <a href="/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing page</a>. We publish it publicly because we think hidden pricing benefits vendors, not buyers. If you want to know what Provyx costs, you shouldn't have to sit through a sales call to find out.</p>

<!-- Who Should Choose What -->

<h2>Who Should Choose What</h2>
<div class="scenario-list">
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need prescribing data and pharma analytics:</strong> IQVIA is the right choice, and it's not particularly close. Their prescribing data connects individual physician behavior to drug class volumes, competitive share, and trend analysis in ways that no other vendor replicates at that scale. If your commercial strategy depends on knowing which physicians are writing scripts for your therapeutic area, or if you need to segment your sales territories by prescribing volume, IQVIA's data assets are purpose-built for that work. The investment is significant, but for large pharma commercial teams, the prescribing intelligence directly drives revenue allocation and field force deployment. A single territory optimization informed by prescribing data can justify the annual license cost. Provyx doesn't offer prescribing data and isn't trying to compete in that space. If prescribing intelligence is core to your commercial model, start the IQVIA conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need healthcare provider contact intelligence:</strong> Provyx was built for this exact use case. You need NPI-verified email addresses, direct phone numbers, and practice-level addresses for providers in specific specialties and geographies. You need them in a format your sales team or marketing platform can actually use, and you need them without committing $50,000+ per year or waiting weeks for implementation. Provyx gives you taxonomy-filtered, NPI-verified provider records delivered as CSV, through an API, or pushed directly into your CRM. Healthcare marketing agencies, medical device reps, and healthcare SaaS vendors consistently tell us that clean provider contact data was the one thing they couldn't get efficiently from enterprise platforms. They didn't need prescribing analytics or global coverage. They needed accurate provider records they could actually use for outreach, and they needed them without an enterprise procurement process. That's the gap Provyx fills.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you have a large enterprise budget:</strong> Some teams use both, and there's a reasonable argument for it. IQVIA provides the prescribing analytics, market intelligence, and global HCP coverage that drive strategic decisions at the brand and portfolio level. Provyx provides the tactical, NPI-verified contact data that field reps and marketing teams need for day-to-day outreach. Running both means your analytics team gets the deep pharma intelligence from IQVIA while your commercial execution team gets fast, flexible access to provider contact records from Provyx without burning through your IQVIA allocation on simple contact pulls. The per-record cost from Provyx for routine contact needs can actually reduce your overall IQVIA spend by keeping your enterprise license focused on the high-value analytics it was designed for. We've seen pharma teams use IQVIA for national brand strategy and territory modeling, then use Provyx for the regional and local contact pulls their field teams request week to week.</p>
