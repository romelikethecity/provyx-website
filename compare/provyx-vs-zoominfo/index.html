<!-- Intro -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <p>If you sell software, services, or products to healthcare providers, you've probably evaluated ZoomInfo. It's the largest general-purpose B2B contact database on the market, and it shows up on almost every shortlist for sales intelligence tools. The problem is that "general-purpose" comes with trade-offs when you need healthcare-specific provider data.</p><p>This comparison is for marketing and sales leaders at healthcare technology companies, medical device manufacturers, staffing firms, pharmaceutical commercial teams, and anyone else whose pipeline depends on reaching the right physicians, practice managers, or clinical decision-makers. We'll walk through pricing structures, data depth, contract terms, and the specific gaps that appear when a horizontal platform tries to serve a vertical market. We'll also be honest about where ZoomInfo has advantages, because it does, particularly if your outreach extends well beyond healthcare.</p><p>Everything here is based on publicly available pricing pages, G2 and Gartner Peer Insights reviews, vendor documentation, and our own product specs. Where we cite Provyx capabilities, we'll tell you exactly where that data comes from: public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases.</p><p>One note before we start: Provyx is not the right tool for everyone reading this. If you prospect heavily outside of healthcare, ZoomInfo may genuinely be the better investment. We'll explain why in the scenario breakdown toward the end of this page. This isn't a comparison designed to steer you toward one answer. It's designed to help you make the call faster.</p>

        <h2>Deep Dive: ZoomInfo</h2>
        <h3>What ZoomInfo Offers</h3><p>ZoomInfo is a publicly traded B2B data and sales intelligence platform that aggregates contact records, company firmographics, technographic signals, and intent data across virtually every industry. Its database includes over 100 million business professional profiles according to the company's own reporting, and it covers companies ranging from two-person startups to Fortune 500 enterprises.</p><p>The platform's core value proposition is breadth. If you're building account lists that span manufacturing, financial services, technology, and healthcare simultaneously, ZoomInfo gives you a single interface to do that. You get access to org charts, direct-dial phone numbers, verified email addresses, and website visitor tracking through its suite of products (SalesOS, MarketingOS, TalentOS).</p><p>For healthcare specifically, ZoomInfo does include records for hospitals, clinics, physician practices, and healthcare executives. You can filter by SIC and NAICS codes related to healthcare, and you can layer on intent signals to identify organizations that are actively researching topics related to your solution. The data is refreshed on a rolling basis through a combination of web scraping, email pattern analysis, user-contributed data, and manual research.</p><p>ZoomInfo also provides workflow automation tools, conversation intelligence (through its Chorus acquisition), and engagement tracking. It's designed to be an all-in-one revenue operations platform, not just a data vendor. That scope is a genuine strength for organizations whose go-to-market motion spans multiple verticals.</p><p>The platform's data collection methods include a contributor network of users who install a browser extension or email plugin. In exchange for free or discounted access, these users share contact data from their email headers and address books. ZoomInfo also crawls public websites, SEC filings, job postings, and social media profiles to build and update its records. For industries where professionals actively maintain public profiles and change jobs in patterns that leave digital trails, this methodology works well. For healthcare, where many providers don't have LinkedIn profiles and practice information is scattered across state licensing boards and federal registries, the methodology has blind spots.</p><p><a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZoomInfo's</a> G2 rating sits at approximately 4.4 out of 5 stars, with over 8,000 reviews. The positive reviews consistently cite the platform's ease of use for prospecting, the depth of company information, and the quality of intent data signals. The negative reviews cluster around pricing complaints, data accuracy for niche industries, and the auto-renewal contract structure. Healthcare-specific complaints are harder to find in the review corpus because most ZoomInfo users are selling into technology, not medicine, but the ones that do surface tend to mention outdated provider contact information and difficulty filtering by clinical specialty.</p>
        <h3>Pricing and Contracts</h3><p>ZoomInfo doesn't publish a simple pricing grid, but the publicly available information and user-reported figures paint a consistent picture. The Professional plan starts at roughly $14,995 per year for a single user with a set number of credits. The Advanced plan, which adds intent data and more detailed company attributes, is typically quoted between $24,995 and $39,995 per year. The Elite tier, which layers on real-time intent signals and AI-driven recommendations, has been reported north of $40,000 annually.</p><p>All plans operate on annual contracts. Renewals are automatic, and you're required to give at least 60 days' written notice before the renewal date to cancel. Multiple <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/zoominfo/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G2 reviews</a> mention being caught off guard by auto-renewal clauses and report annual price increases in the range of 10% to 30% at renewal. If you miss the cancellation window, you're locked in for another full year.</p><p>Seat-based pricing adds up quickly if multiple team members need access. Some organizations report total annual costs exceeding $60,000 to $100,000 when you factor in additional seats, premium features, and overage charges for exceeding credit allotments. For a funded startup or mid-market company focused on a single vertical like healthcare, that price tag can be difficult to justify, especially when much of the database covers industries you'll never prospect into.</p><p>There's also a credit system within each plan. You get a set number of contact and company data credits per billing period, and exceeding those limits triggers overage fees or requires an upgrade. For teams that run large-volume outbound campaigns, credits can deplete faster than expected, especially when building initial target lists for a new market or territory. The combination of annual commitment, seat-based licensing, and credit-based data access creates a pricing model that's optimized for predictable, enterprise-scale usage patterns rather than the variable, campaign-driven patterns common in healthcare sales.</p>
        <h3>Where ZoomInfo Falls Short for Healthcare</h3><p>The gaps aren't about data quality in an absolute sense. ZoomInfo is good at what it does. The gaps are about specificity.</p><p><strong>No NPI verification.</strong> The National Provider Identifier is the universal key for identifying healthcare providers in the United States. Every physician, nurse practitioner, dentist, and clinical professional who bills federal programs has one, and it's maintained by CMS in a <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly searchable registry</a>. ZoomInfo doesn't match its records against NPI data. That means you can't confirm whether a contact is an active, licensed provider, and you can't cross-reference with the taxonomy codes that define their specialty.</p><p><strong>No taxonomy code filtering.</strong> If you need to reach every interventional cardiologist in Texas, or every pediatric nurse practitioner in the Mid-Atlantic, you need to filter by NUCC taxonomy codes. ZoomInfo's filtering relies on job titles and industry classifications, which are inconsistent across healthcare organizations. A "Medical Director" at a three-physician dermatology practice is a very different buyer than a "Medical Director" at a 400-bed hospital system. Taxonomy codes eliminate that ambiguity.</p><p><strong>Practice-level intelligence is thin.</strong> ZoomInfo's company records are built around legal entities and corporate hierarchies. Healthcare doesn't always organize that way. A physician might practice at two hospitals, own a separate outpatient surgery center, and bill under a third entity. ZoomInfo's data model isn't designed to capture those relationships. You often end up with a hospital system's corporate headquarters address rather than the actual clinic location where a provider sees patients.</p><p><strong>Stale specialty data.</strong> Physicians change practice locations, retire, or shift specialties more often than executives change companies. ZoomInfo's refresh cycle, which works well for tracking job changes at tech companies, doesn't always keep pace with the churn in healthcare provider directories. Users targeting healthcare frequently report higher bounce rates on emails and outdated phone numbers compared to their results in other industries.</p><p><strong>You're paying for industries you don't need.</strong> This is the fundamental unit economics problem. If 100% of your revenue comes from healthcare, you're subsidizing ZoomInfo's data collection across dozens of industries you'll never touch. That's a real cost, not just a philosophical objection, because it inflates your per-lead acquisition cost significantly.</p><p><strong>Compliance and data sourcing concerns in healthcare.</strong> ZoomInfo's contributor network model, where users share contact data from their inboxes in exchange for platform access, raises questions in regulated industries. Healthcare organizations are often cautious about how provider contact information is collected and shared. While ZoomInfo's data collection is legal, the sourcing methodology doesn't align with the expectations many healthcare compliance teams have about where their provider contact lists originate. If your compliance team asks "where did this data come from," the answer with ZoomInfo is more complex than it is with a platform that sources exclusively from public registries, business listings, and commercial databases.</p>

<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Deep Dive: Provyx</h2>
        <h3>What Provyx Delivers</h3><p>Provyx is a healthcare provider business data platform. That's all it does. There's no intent data for SaaS companies, no technographic signals for e-commerce brands, and no org charts for financial institutions. Every record in the Provyx database represents a healthcare provider or a practice location, and every record is verified against the National Provider Identifier Registry maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p><p>The database covers physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, optometrists, chiropractors, physical therapists, behavioral health providers, and other licensed clinicians across the United States. Records include NPI numbers, taxonomy codes (using the NUCC classification system), practice addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, affiliated organizations, and, where available, prescribing behavior indicators and referral patterns.</p><p>Data is sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, state licensing boards, and commercial databases. Provyx doesn't scrape social media profiles or rely on user-contributed data from email plugins. The sourcing methodology is designed for a regulated industry where accuracy matters more than volume.</p>
        <h3>How Provyx Handles Healthcare Provider Business Data</h3><p>Every record in Provyx is anchored to an NPI number. That's not a feature bolted onto a general database; it's the primary key around which the entire data model is built. When you search for records, you're starting from a verified identifier that the federal government requires every healthcare provider to have.</p><p>Taxonomy code filtering lets you target providers by their actual clinical specialty, not by a job title that might mean different things at different organizations. There are over 800 NUCC taxonomy codes, and Provyx supports filtering by any of them, individually or in combination. You can pull every orthopedic surgeon within 50 miles of a ZIP code, or every family medicine physician in a specific state, and know that the specialty designation comes from their NPI registration rather than a self-reported LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Practice-level data is another differentiator. Provyx maps providers to their actual practice locations, not just the corporate entity that employs them. If a cardiologist practices at two different hospitals and an outpatient clinic, Provyx shows you all three locations with separate contact details for each.</p><p>There's also the question of data transparency. Every record in Provyx can be traced back to its source: a public NPI registry entry, a state licensing board record, or a verified business listing. When your compliance team or a prospect asks how you got their information, you have a clear, auditable answer. That matters in healthcare in ways it doesn't matter when you're emailing software engineers.</p><p>Geographic filtering works at the ZIP code, city, state, and custom radius level. You can combine geography with taxonomy codes to build highly specific lists: every ophthalmologist within 30 miles of Denver, every psychiatrist in the five boroughs of New York City, or every family medicine physician in rural counties across three Southern states. This kind of granular targeting is what makes the difference between a campaign that generates qualified responses and one that generates unsubscribes.</p>
        <h3>Pricing</h3><p>Provyx uses a pay-per-record model. You buy the records you need, when you need them. There's no annual contract, no auto-renewal, and no 60-day cancellation notice. If you need 500 records for a regional campaign, you pay for 500 records. If you need 50,000 records for a national launch, the per-record price drops with volume, but you're still only paying for what you actually use.</p><p>There are no seat-based licenses. Your entire team can access the records you've purchased. Data is delivered as a CSV file, through an API, or pushed directly into your CRM. You own the records once you've bought them, and there's no recurring platform fee to keep using them.</p><p>This model works especially well for organizations that have seasonal or campaign-based outreach patterns. Medical device companies launching into a new territory, staffing firms filling travel nurse positions, or health-tech startups running their first outbound campaign can all get started without committing to a five-figure annual contract.</p><p>To put it in concrete terms: a medical device company that needs to reach 1,500 orthopedic surgeons in the Midwest for a product launch can buy exactly those 1,500 records. With ZoomInfo, that same company would pay $14,995 minimum for annual platform access that includes millions of records they'll never look at. The math doesn't require a spreadsheet to figure out.</p><p>Provyx doesn't pretend to be the right choice for everyone. If you need intent data, website visitor tracking, or org charts for non-healthcare companies, you'll need a different tool. But for the specific job of sourcing accurate healthcare provider business data at a predictable cost, the pay-per-record model eliminates the overhead and risk that come with enterprise platform contracts.</p>

<h2>Who Should Choose What</h2>
<div class="scenario-list">
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need general B2B data across multiple industries:</strong> ZoomInfo is the stronger choice. If your sales team prospects into healthcare, technology, financial services, and manufacturing in the same quarter, a single horizontal platform will save you from managing multiple vendor relationships. ZoomInfo's breadth is a genuine asset when your total addressable market crosses industry boundaries. Just budget accordingly, as you'll likely spend $15,000 to $60,000 or more per year depending on your team size and feature requirements. Make sure your team has the bandwidth to learn the platform thoroughly. ZoomInfo delivers more value when reps understand its filtering, intent signals, and workflow tools rather than using it as a simple contact lookup.</p>

<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need healthcare-specific provider contact intelligence:</strong> Provyx is built for this exact use case. You'll get NPI-verified records, taxonomy code filtering, practice-level location data, and pricing that doesn't require you to pay for 50 industries you don't sell into. If every dollar in your pipeline comes from healthcare organizations or individual providers, a specialized platform will deliver higher match rates, lower bounce rates, and a significantly lower cost per qualified record. The onboarding is also simpler because there's no complex platform to learn. You tell Provyx what kind of providers you need, and you get a deliverable dataset back.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you have a large enterprise budget and need both:</strong> Some organizations use ZoomInfo for broad prospecting and supplement it with Provyx for healthcare-specific campaigns. This makes sense if you have a dedicated healthcare vertical team alongside teams that sell into other industries. The combined cost is still often lower than upgrading to ZoomInfo's highest tier and trying to force it to do healthcare-specific filtering it wasn't designed for. Evaluate your actual usage patterns before assuming one tool can serve every team. If you go this route, establish clear ownership: one team manages ZoomInfo for general prospecting, and the healthcare team manages Provyx for provider-specific campaigns. Shared tools with unclear ownership tend to be underused by everyone.</p>
