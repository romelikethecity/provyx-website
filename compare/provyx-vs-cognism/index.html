        <p class="hero-subheadline">Cognism built its reputation on phone-verified mobile numbers and European B2B coverage. Provyx was built from the ground up for healthcare provider business data in the US. Here's how they compare when your target buyer works in a clinic, hospital, or practice.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Intro -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <p>If you sell into healthcare, you've probably noticed that general-purpose sales intelligence platforms don't quite fit. The data you need isn't just a name, title, and phone number. You need NPI numbers, taxonomy codes, practice locations, and the ability to filter by specialty at a granular level. That's where the Provyx vs. Cognism comparison gets interesting.</p><p>Cognism is a well-regarded B2B data provider, especially popular in Europe and among teams that rely heavily on outbound calling. Their Diamond Data product offers phone-verified mobile numbers, which is genuinely useful if you're trying to reach decision-makers across industries. They've earned strong reviews on G2 and built a loyal customer base in EMEA markets. For general B2B prospecting, particularly in European territories, Cognism is a serious contender.</p><p>But Cognism wasn't designed for healthcare. It doesn't carry NPI data, doesn't support taxonomy code filtering, and its US coverage—particularly for healthcare providers—is thinner than what most domestic teams need. If you're a medical device rep trying to find orthopedic surgeons in a specific metro area, or a pharma sales team segmenting by provider specialty, Cognism simply wasn't built for that workflow. The fields and filters that healthcare teams depend on daily don't exist in a platform optimized for general business contacts.</p><p>Provyx was. This page breaks down both platforms honestly: what each one does well, where they fall short, and which one makes sense depending on your use case. No spin, just a clear-eyed comparison so you can pick the right tool for the job you actually need to do.</p>

<!-- Deep Dive: Competitor -->
<section class="content-section">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Deep Dive: Cognism</h2>
        <h3>What Cognism Offers</h3><p>Cognism is a London-headquartered B2B sales intelligence platform that's grown quickly since its founding in 2015. The company has carved out a strong position in the European market and earned a reputation for data quality, particularly around direct-dial phone numbers. If you're running outbound sales in EMEA, Cognism is one of the first names that comes up, and for good reason.</p><p>The platform's headline feature is Diamond Data: phone-verified mobile numbers that Cognism's in-house research team has manually confirmed. This isn't just scraping numbers from the web or pulling them from third-party aggregators. Their team actually calls the numbers to verify they're active and reach the right person. For SDR teams that live and die by connect rates, this is a real differentiator. Cognism claims a significantly higher connect rate on Diamond Data numbers compared to unverified alternatives, and user reviews on G2 generally back that up. When your entire outbound motion depends on getting someone on the phone, having numbers that actually ring through to the right person matters more than having a larger but less accurate database.</p><p>Beyond phone numbers, Cognism provides a database of roughly 400 million business profiles with email addresses, company data, technographic signals, and intent data through partnerships. Their Chrome extension lets reps pull contact info while browsing LinkedIn, and their platform integrates with major CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot. They also offer a prospecting tool for building targeted lists by industry, company size, job title, seniority, and geography. The workflow is familiar to anyone who's used a modern sales intelligence tool: define your ICP, build a list, enrich contacts, push to your CRM or sequencer.</p><p>One of Cognism's genuine strengths is compliance. They've invested heavily in GDPR compliance and maintain Do Not Call lists for multiple European countries, including the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, and others. If your sales team operates across EU markets, this matters a lot. Data privacy regulations in Europe are strict and actively enforced, and Cognism's compliance infrastructure gives teams confidence that they're not running afoul of local laws. They also hold ISO 27001 and SOC 2 certifications, which enterprise procurement teams increasingly require.</p><p>Their data sourcing model combines several approaches. The Diamond Data phone verification is handled by a proprietary in-house team. Email and company data come from public sources, web scraping, and data partnerships. Cognism has also made acquisitions to expand its data assets and technology stack. The result is a platform that's broadest and deepest in European markets, with growing but still uneven coverage in North America.</p><p>On G2, Cognism holds a rating of approximately 4.6 stars with over 700 reviews. Users consistently praise the quality of phone-verified data, the ease of use of the Chrome extension, and the responsiveness of their customer success team. Negative reviews tend to focus on gaps in US data coverage, limited filtering for niche industries, and the cost relative to what smaller teams can afford. Several reviewers note that the platform works best when you're targeting mid-market and enterprise companies in European markets, and is less effective for specialized verticals or US-only outreach.</p><p>Cognism also offers Bombora intent data integration, which helps teams identify accounts that are actively researching topics related to their product. This can be useful for prioritizing outreach and timing campaigns around buying signals, though intent data quality varies across all providers and shouldn't be treated as a silver bullet. The intent signals work best when combined with accurate contact data, which brings the conversation back to whether Cognism's contact database has the coverage you need in your specific market.</p><p>In short, Cognism is a polished, well-reviewed platform that excels at a specific job: giving European-focused B2B sales teams verified phone numbers and compliant contact data. It's not trying to be everything to everyone, and within its sweet spot, it performs well. The question is whether that sweet spot overlaps with what healthcare teams actually need.</p>
        <h3>Pricing and Contracts</h3><p>Cognism doesn't publish pricing on its website, which is standard for enterprise B2B data platforms. Based on publicly available estimates and user reports, annual contracts typically start in the $15,000 to $25,000 range per year, with costs scaling based on the number of seats, credit volume, and add-on features like intent data. Larger teams or organizations that need higher credit volumes can expect costs to climb above that range. Some reports from enterprise buyers suggest contracts in the $30,000 to $50,000+ range for multi-seat deployments with full feature access.</p><p>Annual contracts are the norm. Cognism generally doesn't offer month-to-month plans, and most users report signing 12-month agreements. Some teams have negotiated shorter pilot periods, but that's the exception rather than the rule. This means you're committing meaningful budget before you've fully validated whether the data works for your specific market. For healthcare teams evaluating the platform, this is a significant consideration: you're locking in for a year on a tool that may not have the provider-level data fields you need.</p><p>For teams focused on healthcare provider outreach in the US, the pricing question gets complicated. You're paying enterprise rates for a platform that wasn't built for your vertical. The phone-verified numbers are valuable if your targets are general business contacts, but healthcare provider workflows need NPI matching, specialty filtering, and practice-level location data that Cognism doesn't include. So you may find yourself paying $20,000+ per year and still needing a supplemental data source for your healthcare campaigns. That's effectively double the data spend for partial coverage in both tools.</p><p>Credit-based systems also create friction for teams that need large volumes of provider records. If you're building a list of 10,000 dermatologists or pulling contact data for every primary care provider in a three-state region, credit limits can become a bottleneck quickly. Healthcare data projects often involve bulk pulls—territory mapping, conference attendee enrichment, regional campaign targeting—and credit-based access models can make those projects more expensive than they need to be. It's worth asking detailed questions about credit allocation and overage costs during the sales process before you commit to a contract.</p>
        <h3>Where Cognism Falls Short for Healthcare Teams</h3><p>Cognism is a strong platform for what it was designed to do. But if your outreach targets are healthcare providers in the United States, there are real gaps you should understand before signing a contract.</p><p><strong>No NPI data.</strong> This is the most fundamental gap. The National Provider Identifier is the standard unique identifier for healthcare providers in the US. It's how CRMs, compliance teams, and marketing platforms track and deduplicate provider records. Cognism doesn't carry NPI numbers, which means you can't match their data against your existing provider databases, verify that a contact is a licensed provider, or filter by the NPI-linked taxonomy codes that define clinical specialties. For any team that already has NPI numbers in their CRM as primary identifiers, Cognism's data requires manual matching work just to be usable.</p><p><strong>No taxonomy code filtering.</strong> Healthcare sales teams don't think in terms of generic job titles. They think in specialties: interventional cardiology, pediatric endocrinology, orthopedic surgery. The NUCC taxonomy system includes over 800 codes that map to specific provider types and specializations. Cognism's filtering relies on standard B2B fields like job title, industry, and company size. You can search for "cardiologist," but you can't distinguish between an interventional cardiologist and a cardiac electrophysiologist the way taxonomy codes allow. When your product is relevant to one subspecialty but not another, this distinction is the difference between a qualified lead and a wasted call.</p><p><strong>Thin US healthcare coverage.</strong> Cognism's strongest data is in EMEA. While they've expanded their US database, user reviews consistently note that US coverage lags behind European data in both volume and accuracy. Layer on the healthcare vertical—where providers often work across multiple locations, use practice phone numbers instead of personal mobiles, and aren't well-represented in general B2B databases—and coverage gets even thinner. If you're targeting US healthcare providers specifically, you'll likely find significant gaps in Cognism's database compared to what a healthcare-focused data source provides.</p><p><strong>No practice-level location data.</strong> Healthcare providers often practice at multiple locations. A surgeon might operate at two hospitals and see patients at a separate clinic. A primary care physician could split time between a main practice and a satellite office in a neighboring county. Cognism's data model is built around company-contact pairs, not provider-practice relationships. You won't get the multi-location practice data that field sales teams and regional marketers need to plan territory coverage effectively.</p><p><strong>Phone-first model has limits in healthcare.</strong> Cognism's Diamond Data is built around verifying mobile numbers for business contacts. But many healthcare providers are best reached through practice phone numbers, office lines, or email. Cold-calling a surgeon's personal mobile is often less effective (and less welcome) than reaching their practice or office staff. In many healthcare sales workflows, the initial outreach goes through the practice or through a gatekeeper, not directly to a personal cell phone. The phone-verification advantage is real in general B2B but less of a differentiator in healthcare outreach, where the path to a conversation looks different.</p><p><strong>No understanding of provider relationships.</strong> Healthcare sales often involves understanding referral networks, group practice affiliations, and hospital system relationships. A medical device company doesn't just need to find surgeons; they need to know which hospital system those surgeons operate in, which group practice they belong to, and what locations they cover. Cognism's data model doesn't capture these healthcare-specific relationships, because it was never designed to.</p>

Every feature, every data field, and every filtering option was built specifically for teams that sell to, market to, or work with healthcare providers in the United States.</p><p>The core product is provider contact data: NPI numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, mailing addresses, and practice locations. Records are sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases, then verified against the CMS NPI Registry. This means you're working with data that's tied to a real, identifiable provider—not a best-guess match based on name and company. Every record traces back to a valid NPI, which gives you a reliable key for deduplication, CRM matching, and compliance.</p><p>Taxonomy code filtering is where Provyx really separates from general-purpose tools. The NUCC taxonomy system includes over 800 codes covering provider types and clinical specializations. You can pull a list of every pediatric allergist in Texas, or every nurse practitioner specializing in psychiatric care in the Northeast, or every orthopedic surgeon with a sports medicine subspecialty within a 50-mile radius of a target hospital. That level of precision simply doesn't exist in platforms built for broad B2B prospecting.</p><p>Data delivery is flexible: CSV downloads, API access, or direct CRM push. You're not locked into using a proprietary platform to access your data. Buy the records you need, get them in the format that works for your stack, and move on. There's no seat-based pricing and no annual contract requirement. Your data team can pull records into a warehouse, your sales ops team can push them directly to Salesforce, and your agency clients can get CSV deliverables. Same data, different pipes.</p><p>Provyx is purpose-built for healthcare marketing agencies, medical device sales teams, healthcare SaaS vendors, and pharma sales organizations. If that's your world, the data model will feel familiar immediately. If you're selling software to European CFOs or building lists of IT directors at mid-market companies, Provyx isn't the right tool. It's specialized, and that specialization is the point.</p>
        <h3>How Provyx Handles Healthcare Provider Business Data</h3><p>It's worth being specific about what "healthcare provider business data" actually means, because the term gets confused with patient health data regularly. Provyx sells business contact information for healthcare providers: the people and practices that deliver care. Think of it as a B2B data vendor that operates exclusively in the healthcare vertical. No patient records. No clinical data. No PHI. This is business data about providers, not health data about patients.</p><p>The foundation of every Provyx record is the NPI number. The National Provider Identifier is a unique 10-digit number assigned by CMS to every healthcare provider in the US. It's the closest thing to a universal ID in healthcare, and it's what makes provider data actually usable at scale. With an NPI, you can deduplicate records across systems, verify that a contact is a real licensed provider, and link to the taxonomy codes that describe their specialty. If you've ever tried to merge provider lists from two different sources and ended up with duplicates because name matching isn't reliable, you understand why NPI-keyed data matters.</p><p>Taxonomy codes are the second critical layer. The NUCC (National Uniform Claim Committee) maintains a standardized set of over 800 codes that classify providers by type and specialization. Provyx supports filtering across all of these codes, which means you can build highly targeted lists that go far beyond what generic title-based filtering allows. The difference between "orthopedic surgeon" and "orthopedic surgery—sports medicine" matters when you're selling a sports injury recovery device. The difference between "family medicine" and "family medicine—adolescent medicine" matters when you're marketing a pediatric-adjacent product. Taxonomy codes give you that precision.</p><p>Practice-level location data rounds out the picture. Healthcare providers frequently work at multiple locations, and knowing where a provider actually sees patients is critical for field sales teams, regional marketing campaigns, and territory planning. Provyx records include practice addresses tied to NPI data, giving you location-level precision rather than just a headquarters address. A field rep planning their week needs to know which office a target provider will be at on which days, not just which health system employs them.</p><p>Data sourcing combines public NPI registry data from CMS, business listing information, and commercial databases. Records are cross-referenced to improve accuracy, and NPI verification acts as a persistent quality check. If a record can't be matched to a valid NPI, it doesn't make the cut. This is a deliberate trade-off: Provyx would rather give you fewer records that are verified than a larger database padded with unverified or stale entries.</p><p>This approach won't win any awards for breadth. Provyx doesn't cover European markets, doesn't provide intent data, and doesn't have a Chrome extension for LinkedIn prospecting. It doesn't track technographic signals or company funding rounds. But for the specific job of providing accurate, filterable, NPI-verified healthcare provider business data in the US, the depth is hard to match with a general-purpose tool. You're trading breadth for precision, and if healthcare providers are your market, that's usually the right trade.</p>
        <h3>Pricing</h3><p>Provyx uses pay-per-record pricing. You buy the provider records you need and pay for what you use. There's no annual contract, no seat-based licensing, and no minimum commitment that forces you to justify a $15,000+ line item before you've validated the data against your use case. You can start with a small pull to test data quality in your target segment, and scale up only when you've confirmed it works for your workflow.</p><p>This pricing model is a deliberate choice. Healthcare sales and marketing teams often have variable data needs. A medical device company launching in a new territory might need 5,000 records one quarter and 500 the next. An agency running a campaign for a client might need a one-time pull of specialists in a specific region. A pharma sales team expanding into a new therapeutic area might need to rebuild their target list from scratch around different taxonomy codes. Locking these teams into annual contracts with credit-based systems adds cost and friction that doesn't match how they actually work.</p><p>The trade-off is that Provyx doesn't bundle in the platform features you'd get with an enterprise tool like Cognism: no built-in email sequencing, no intent data dashboard, no real-time enrichment API for website visitors, and no Chrome extension for browsing LinkedIn profiles. You're buying data, not a sales engagement suite. For teams that already have their outreach tools in place—whether that's Outreach, Salesloft, HubSpot, or something else—and just need better provider data feeding into them, that's a good fit. For teams looking for an all-in-one platform that handles both data and outreach, it's a limitation worth considering.</p><p>Delivery is included in the per-record price regardless of format. CSV, API, or CRM push—you choose how you want to receive your data, and it doesn't change the cost. There are no extra fees for API access and no premium tier required to get CRM integrations.</p>

<!-- Who Should Choose What -->

<h2>Who Should Choose What</h2>
<div class="scenario-list">
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need phone-verified European B2B contacts:</strong> Cognism is the stronger choice, and it's not close. Their Diamond Data product provides manually verified mobile numbers with genuinely high connect rates, and their EMEA coverage is among the best in the market. If your sales team is calling into the UK, Germany, France, or other European markets across a range of industries, Cognism's compliance infrastructure and verified phone data will serve you well. Their GDPR compliance work, Do Not Call list maintenance, and ISO certifications remove a lot of the risk that comes with European outbound. Provyx doesn't operate in this space at all. It's focused exclusively on US healthcare provider business data, so if your targets are European business contacts in any industry, Provyx simply isn't the right tool. Go with Cognism and take advantage of what they've built for that market.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you need US healthcare provider contact intelligence:</strong> Provyx is the clear fit. You'll get NPI-verified records, taxonomy code filtering across 800+ specialties and provider types, and practice-level location data that Cognism doesn't carry. Medical device reps can filter by surgical specialty and geography to build territory-specific call lists. Pharma sales teams can segment by prescribing specialty to match their drug's therapeutic area. Healthcare marketing agencies can build precisely targeted lists for client campaigns without manually cross-referencing NPI data from a separate source. And you'll do it on a pay-per-record basis without committing to an annual contract or worrying about credit limits on bulk pulls. Cognism's general B2B data model doesn't include the healthcare-specific fields that make this kind of targeting possible. If your buyers are US healthcare providers, start with Provyx.</p>
</div>
<div class="scenario">
<p><strong>If you have budget for both:</strong> There's a case for running Provyx and Cognism side by side if your organization sells into healthcare providers in the US and also runs outbound campaigns into European markets or non-healthcare verticals. Use Provyx for your healthcare provider data needs: the NPI verification, taxonomy filtering, and practice-level data will be your source of truth for provider outreach. Use Cognism for verified phone numbers when you're reaching out to European business contacts or non-clinical decision-makers (like hospital administrators or health system IT buyers) who don't appear in healthcare-specific databases. The two tools don't overlap much, which means you'd get distinct value from each. Just make sure you're getting enough ROI from each tool to justify the combined spend. Cognism's annual contract is a meaningful commitment, so validate the use case and data coverage before signing.</p>
