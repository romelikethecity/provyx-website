            <h1>Best ZoomInfo Alternative for Healthcare Provider Data</h1>
            <p class="hero-subtitle">ZoomInfo covers every industry. Provyx covers one: healthcare. If your sales team only sells to physicians, clinics, and health systems, you don't need a $15K/year general-purpose database. You need provider contact intelligence sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases, delivered at a fraction of the cost with no annual contract and no seat licenses.</p>

    <!-- Why Teams Look for an Alternative -->
    <section class="content-section why-switch-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Why Sales Teams Look for a ZoomInfo Alternative in Healthcare</h2>
            <p>ZoomInfo is the default choice for B2B sales intelligence, and for good reason. It covers more than 50 industries, integrates with every major CRM, and maintains one of the largest business contact databases on the market. For a general sales org prospecting across verticals, it works.</p><p>The problems start when your team <em>only</em> sells into healthcare.</p><p><strong>Pricing that assumes you need everything.</strong> <a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZoomInfo</a> plans start at roughly $14,995 per year for the SalesOS tier, billed annually. That price gets you access to its full multi-industry database, intent data signals, and workflow automation tools. If your reps are calling on orthopedic surgeons and dental practices, you're paying for millions of records in manufacturing, financial services, tech, and retail that you'll never open. The per-seat cost rises quickly once you add users or move to the Advanced or Elite tiers. A three-seat team on the Advanced plan can easily cross $25,000 per year before adding any integrations or premium data credits.</p><p><strong>Annual contracts with aggressive renewal terms.</strong> ZoomInfo contracts auto-renew unless you send written cancellation at least 60 days before the renewal date. Miss that window by a week and you're locked in for another year. Multiple customer reports cite renewal price increases of 10 to 30 percent, applied automatically. For a mid-size sales team, that can mean an unexpected jump from $15K to $18K or more with no new features added. The cancellation process itself requires written notice sent to a specific address or email, not just a button click in the dashboard. Teams that don't calendar the deadline in advance often discover the renewal after the window has already passed.</p><p><strong>No NPI verification or taxonomy classification.</strong> ZoomInfo identifies contacts by company, title, and industry code. It doesn't cross-reference the <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES)</a> to verify that a contact is a licensed healthcare provider with a valid NPI number. It doesn't attach taxonomy codes that tell you whether a physician is a family medicine practitioner, an interventional cardiologist, or a pediatric neurologist. For healthcare sales, that distinction isn't optional. A medical device rep selling spinal implants can't work from a list that lumps all physicians together. Without taxonomy codes, your ops team has to manually research each contact's specialty, which turns a data problem into a labor problem.</p><p><strong>Practice-level data gaps.</strong> ZoomInfo is built around companies and contacts. Healthcare operates around practices, clinics, and provider groups. You might find a physician's name and a hospital affiliation, but you won't reliably get the practice's direct phone line, the office address where they actually see patients, or the practice owner's name. That gap creates friction for reps who need to reach decision-makers at independent or small group practices, which still represent a significant share of the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare workforce</a>. When a rep dials the main hospital switchboard trying to reach a dermatologist who sees patients at a separate office three miles away, that's a data gap costing the rep time and costing you pipeline velocity.</p><p><strong>Data freshness for a changing industry.</strong> Healthcare providers change practice locations, retire, switch specialties, and open new offices more frequently than contacts in most B2B industries. A physician who was at a group practice six months ago may now be at a different organization or running their own practice. ZoomInfo updates its general database on its own cycle, but it doesn't have a healthcare-specific refresh process tied to NPI registry updates. Stale records mean bounced mail, disconnected numbers, and wasted rep effort.</p><p>None of this makes ZoomInfo a bad product. It makes it a general-purpose product. If your entire go-to-market motion targets healthcare providers, a general-purpose database forces your team to do manual enrichment work that a purpose-built source should handle.</p>

    <!-- What Healthcare Teams Actually Need -->
    <section class="content-section what-teams-need-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>What Healthcare Sales Teams Actually Need from Provider Data</h2>
            <p>Selling to healthcare providers is different from selling to software companies or retail chains. The data requirements reflect that difference.</p><p><strong>NPI verification.</strong> Every physician, nurse practitioner, dentist, and allied health professional who bills a payer has a National Provider Identifier. That 10-digit number is the closest thing healthcare has to a universal business ID. When your data includes verified NPIs, you know the contact is a real, credentialed provider, not a retired physician, a student, or a mismatched record. Databases without NPI verification force your ops team to cross-check manually, which burns hours and still misses errors.</p><p><strong>Taxonomy codes for specialty segmentation.</strong> Healthcare taxonomy codes (maintained by NUCC) classify providers into more than 800 specialties and sub-specialties. A taxonomy code tells you not just that someone is a physician, but that they practice orthopedic surgery, or more specifically, orthopedic surgery of the spine. If you sell a product that's relevant to 3 specialties out of 800, taxonomy filtering is the difference between a targeted list and a spray-and-pray campaign.</p><p><strong>Practice-level records, not just employer records.</strong> A cardiologist might be affiliated with a hospital system but see patients at a private practice three days a week. The practice address, phone number, fax, and office manager matter more to a sales rep than the hospital system's corporate headquarters. Generic B2B databases tend to map providers to their largest known affiliation rather than their actual practice location.</p><p><strong>Owner and decision-maker identification.</strong> In small and mid-size practices, the physician owner is the buyer. There's no VP of Procurement to route through. Knowing who owns the practice, and being able to reach them directly, compresses the sales cycle. Generic databases rarely surface ownership information for medical practices because their data models aren't designed for it.</p><p><strong>Specialty-aware geographic filtering.</strong> Healthcare markets are local. A rep covering Houston needs providers in Houston, not a national list filtered by state. The ability to filter by specialty, sub-specialty, and geography simultaneously, down to the ZIP code or metro level, is how teams build territory-aligned prospect lists that reps can actually work. Generic databases offer geographic filtering, but combining it with healthcare-specific taxonomy codes is where most of them fall short.</p><p>These aren't nice-to-have features. They're the baseline for any team running outbound sales or marketing campaigns into the healthcare provider market.</p>

    <!-- How Provyx Works as an Alternative -->
    <section class="content-section how-it-works-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>How Provyx Works as a ZoomInfo Alternative for Healthcare</h2>
            <p>Provyx is a healthcare provider business data platform. It doesn't try to cover every industry. It covers one vertical deeply and does it well, combining public registry data with commercial data sources to build verified, practice-level provider records that sales teams can act on immediately.</p><h3>Where the Data Comes From</h3><p>Provyx sources its provider contact intelligence from three categories of data:</p><ul><li><strong>Public NPI registries.</strong> The NPPES database, maintained by CMS, is the authoritative source for provider identification. Provyx ingests the full NPI registry and uses it as the foundation for every record. This gives you verified NPI numbers, taxonomy codes, enumeration dates, and practice addresses as reported to CMS.</li><li><strong>Business listings and public filings.</strong> State licensing boards, secretary of state filings, business directories, and public web data fill in practice details that the NPI registry doesn't include: direct phone numbers, websites, office hours, and ownership information.</li><li><strong>Commercial databases.</strong> Third-party data providers contribute firmographic details, technology stack information, and contact enrichment. This layer adds LinkedIn profile URLs, estimated practice revenue ranges, and staff size indicators where available.</li></ul><p>Every record passes through a matching process that links the NPI to the enriched practice profile. Records that can't be confidently matched are flagged, not shipped.</p><h3>NPI Verification Process</h3><p>When Provyx delivers a provider record, the NPI on that record has been verified against the current NPPES data. That means the NPI is active (not deactivated), it matches the provider's name, and the associated taxonomy code reflects their current reported specialty. This sounds simple, but it eliminates a common problem: stale records where a provider has retired, moved, or changed specialties. ZoomInfo's records don't go through this step because NPI data isn't part of their data model.</p><h3>What's in Each Record</h3><p>A standard Provyx provider record includes:</p><ul><li>Provider full name (individual or organization)</li><li>NPI number (Type 1 for individuals, Type 2 for organizations)</li><li>Primary and secondary taxonomy codes with plain-language specialty labels</li><li>Practice name and doing-business-as name</li><li>Practice mailing address and practice location address</li><li>Phone number and fax number</li><li>Practice website URL</li><li>Practice owner name (where available from public records)</li><li>LinkedIn profile URL (where matched with high confidence)</li><li>Enumeration date (when the NPI was first assigned)</li></ul><p>Not every field is populated on every record. Coverage rates vary by field: NPI and taxonomy are at 100% by definition, phone numbers are above 85%, websites are around 70%, and LinkedIn matches are closer to 55%. Provyx publishes its field-level coverage rates so you know what to expect before you buy.</p><h3>Delivery Formats</h3><p>You can get your data three ways:</p><ul><li><strong>CSV download.</strong> Flat file, ready for import into any CRM or spreadsheet. Most customers start here.</li><li><strong>Excel download.</strong> Formatted workbook with column headers and basic filtering. Useful for handing directly to reps.</li><li><strong>API access.</strong> RESTful API for pulling records into your own systems programmatically. Available on growth plans.</li></ul><h3>Pricing Model</h3><p>Provyx charges per record. You define the specialty, geography, and filters you need, and you pay for the records that match. There's no annual contract. There's no seat license. If you need 500 orthopedic surgeon records in Texas, you pay for 500 records. If you need 50,000 primary care providers nationwide, the per-record price drops at volume. You won't get a surprise renewal invoice 12 months later because there's nothing to renew unless you choose to reorder.</p><p>This model works well for teams with variable data needs. If you're launching into a new territory, you buy records for that territory. If you're running a one-time campaign targeting a specific specialty, you buy that list once. There's no pressure to justify an annual platform cost across months when you aren't actively buying data.</p>

            <h2>What Provyx Doesn't Do</h2>
            <p>Provyx isn't a drop-in replacement for everything ZoomInfo offers, and it's not trying to be.</p><p>Provyx doesn't cover 50+ industries. If your company sells to healthcare providers <em>and</em> to financial services firms and tech startups, you'll still need a general B2B database for those other verticals. Provyx only covers healthcare.</p><p>Provyx isn't an all-in-one sales platform. There's no built-in email sequencing, no phone dialer, no intent data scoring, and no conversation intelligence. It's a data layer. You plug the data into the outreach tools you already use, whether that's Salesloft, Outreach, HubSpot, or a basic CRM with email templates.</p><p>Provyx doesn't provide hospital financial data, claims volume analytics, or health system org charts. If you need those things, a platform like Definitive Healthcare is better suited for that specific job. Provyx focuses on getting you accurate, verified contact records for individual providers and practices.</p><p>It also doesn't provide buyer intent signals, website visitor identification, or technographic data outside of healthcare practices. If those capabilities drive your current workflow in ZoomInfo, you'd lose them by switching. For teams where the primary value was always the healthcare contact data, those features were extras they never adopted.</p><p>Knowing what a tool doesn't do saves you as much time as knowing what it does.</p>

    <!-- Who Switches to Provyx -->
    <section class="content-section who-switches-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Who Switches from ZoomInfo to Provyx</h2>
            <p>Not every ZoomInfo customer is a good fit for Provyx. The teams that switch tend to share a common trait: healthcare is their only vertical, not one of many. Here are the profiles that make the move most often.</p><h3>Medical Device Sales Teams</h3><p>A spinal implant company with 30 reps doesn't need a database of 200 million contacts across every industry. They need orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and pain management specialists, segmented by taxonomy code and geography. They were paying ZoomInfo $25K or more per year for a platform where 95% of the records were irrelevant. Provyx gives them exactly the provider list they need at a fraction of the annual cost, with NPI verification already done. Device reps also benefit from practice-level data because many purchasing decisions happen at the practice or ambulatory surgery center level, not at a hospital purchasing department.</p><h3>Healthcare Marketing Agencies</h3><p>Agencies running campaigns for healthcare clients need specialty-specific lists on a regular basis. One month it's dermatologists in the Southeast, the next it's pediatric dentists in the Midwest. ZoomInfo's annual contract and per-seat pricing doesn't fit an agency model where data needs change per client engagement. Provyx's pay-per-record model lets agencies buy what they need for each campaign without carrying a fixed annual cost. Agencies can also pass through the exact data cost to clients on a per-project basis, keeping margins transparent and predictable.</p><h3>Health IT Companies</h3><p>Companies selling EHR systems, practice management software, or telehealth platforms to physician practices need to know what technology a practice currently uses. Provyx's commercial data layer includes technology detection signals for practice websites, so health IT sales teams can filter by current EHR vendor, online scheduling presence, or patient portal adoption. That kind of technographic filtering on healthcare practices specifically isn't something ZoomInfo exposes at the practice level. A health IT company targeting practices still running legacy PM software can build that list in Provyx without manually auditing practice websites one by one.</p><h3>Pharma Commercial Teams</h3><p>Pharmaceutical sales teams that need prescriber-level data, segmented by specialty and region, often find ZoomInfo's data too broad and its contracts too rigid. A regional pharma company doesn't need an enterprise license. They need 2,000 endocrinologists in five states with verified NPIs and direct office phone numbers. Provyx delivers that as a single list purchase with no ongoing commitment. The NPI on each record also allows pharma teams to cross-reference with their own prescriber databases and compliance systems.</p>

    <!-- Migration Guide -->
    <section class="content-section migration-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>How to Switch from ZoomInfo to Provyx</h2>
            <p>Switching data providers doesn't have to be a six-month project. Here's a practical path.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Request a sample list.</strong> Pick a specialty and geography that your team actively prospects. Ask Provyx for a sample file of 50 to 100 records. Compare the fields, coverage, and accuracy against what you're currently pulling from ZoomInfo. Pay attention to phone number accuracy, NPI presence, and taxonomy detail.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Run a side-by-side test.</strong> Give your reps both lists for the same territory. Track connect rates, bounce rates on addresses, and time-to-qualification. Provider data quality shows up fast in outbound metrics. If reps connect with more decision-makers per dial, the data is working.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Start with a single list purchase.</strong> Don't commit to a full migration on day one. Buy one list for one team or one territory. Import it into your CRM alongside your existing data. Let your reps use it for two to four weeks and collect feedback.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Scale based on results.</strong> If the data performs, expand to more specialties and geographies. Provyx's per-record pricing means you can scale up incrementally without negotiating a new contract tier. If your ZoomInfo renewal is approaching, time your Provyx trial so you have data to make the decision before the 60-day cancellation window closes.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Notify your team and update workflows.</strong> If you decide to move forward, update your CRM import templates to match Provyx's column structure. Brief your reps on any new fields like taxonomy codes and NPI numbers that they weren't seeing in ZoomInfo data. Most teams find that the transition takes one to two days of admin work, not weeks.</p><p>Most teams complete the evaluation in two to three weeks. The ones that plan around their ZoomInfo renewal date avoid getting locked into another year.</p>
