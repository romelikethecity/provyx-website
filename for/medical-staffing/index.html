    <!-- The Pain -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Your Recruiters Are Calling the Wrong People</h2>
        <p>Medical staffing is a relationship business built on speed. When a hospital needs a travel nurse or a clinic needs a locum tenens physician, the agency that responds fastest with the right candidate wins. But speed doesn't help if your recruiters are calling the wrong person at the wrong facility.</p>

<p>The contact data problem in medical staffing is specific: you don't just need to know that a hospital exists. You need the name and direct line of the person who handles staffing, whether that's a nurse manager, an HR director, a department head, or a practice administrator. Most healthcare databases list the facility and maybe a main phone number. Your recruiter calls, gets routed through a phone tree, leaves a voicemail with someone who has nothing to do with hiring, and moves on to the next number. Multiply that by 50 calls a day across your recruiting team and you're burning enormous amounts of time on dead-end outreach.</p>

<p>Facility type matters too. Your agency might specialize in placing nurses in hospitals and urgent care centers, or you might focus on administrative staff for private practices. A generic list of "healthcare facilities" in a metro area doesn't distinguish between a 500-bed hospital system, a two-provider family medicine clinic, and a dental office. Your recruiters need lists filtered by facility type, size, and specialty focus so they're calling on organizations that actually hire the roles you place.</p>

<p>Tracking facility openings and expansions is another challenge. When a new urgent care opens or a hospital adds a wing, that's a staffing opportunity. But by the time that news shows up in your database, three other agencies have already made contact. The <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPI Registry</a> tracks new organizational NPI registrations, which can signal new facilities, but monitoring it manually isn't practical.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> projects strong growth across most healthcare occupations through the next decade. Demand for staffing services is increasing, which means more facilities to cover and more competition among agencies. Better data isn't optional anymore. It's the difference between your recruiters spending time selling and spending time searching.</p>

    <!-- How They Use Provyx -->
    <section class="content-section bg-light">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How Medical Staffing Agencies Use Provyx</h2>
        <p>Staffing agencies use Provyx to build and maintain facility-level contact lists that connect recruiters directly to the people who make hiring decisions. Here's how.</p>

<p><strong>Facility-type filtered outreach lists.</strong> Tell us what types of facilities you staff: hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, urgent care clinics, nursing homes, private practices, or any combination. We deliver a list filtered to those facility types with administrator and decision-maker contacts attached. Your recruiters stop wasting time on facilities that don't match your placement specialties.</p>

<p><strong>Decision-maker identification.</strong> Standard Provyx records include the facility's registered contact, but our enrichment process identifies practice administrators, office managers, HR directors, and department heads where that information is available from public and commercial sources. For a recruiter, reaching the hiring manager on the first call instead of the third is a meaningful time savings.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic territory builds.</strong> Whether your agency covers a single metro area or operates nationally, you can get lists segmented by any geographic filter: zip code, county, MSA, state, or custom radius. Recruiters covering specific territories get only the facilities in their assigned area, which keeps outreach focused and reduces overlap between team members.</p>

<p><strong>New facility monitoring.</strong> We can flag recently registered organizational NPIs in your target geographies, which often correspond to new practice openings or facility expansions. This helps your team reach out to new facilities early, before they've established relationships with competing agencies.</p>

<p><strong>CRM cleanup and enrichment.</strong> Send us your existing facility database and we'll match records against current sources, update stale contacts, fill in missing fields, and identify facilities that have closed or changed ownership. Most staffing agencies accumulate contact data over years, and a significant percentage of it degrades without regular maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Specialty-specific facility lists.</strong> If you place orthopedic surgeons, you need facilities with orthopedic departments. If you staff behavioral health professionals, you need psychiatric facilities and counseling centers. Provyx filters by the specialties practiced at each facility, not just the facility type, so your lists match the roles you actually place.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- What Data You Get -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>What Data You Get in Every Record</h2>
        <p>Records are assembled from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases. Standard fields include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facility or practice name</strong> and <strong>DBA name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Full address</strong>, validated and geocoded</li>
<li><strong>Business phone number</strong>, verified active</li>
<li><strong>Facility website URL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Administrator, owner, or decision-maker name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Organizational NPI number</strong> and <strong>taxonomy codes</strong> indicating facility type and specialty focus</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn profile URL</strong> for decision-makers where available</li>
</ul>

<p>Add-ons for staffing agencies:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Direct email addresses</strong> for administrators and hiring contacts</li>
<li><strong>Mobile phone numbers</strong> for decision-makers</li>
<li><strong>Facility firmographics</strong>: bed count (hospitals), provider headcount, estimated revenue, number of locations</li>
<li><strong>Technology detection</strong>: staffing platforms, scheduling software, and credentialing systems in use</li>
</ul>

<p>Data is delivered as CSV or Excel, formatted for import into your ATS, CRM, or staffing platform.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="content-section bg-light">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Tell us what you staff and where.</strong> Share the facility types, specialties, and geographic areas your agency covers. If you have role-specific requirements (e.g., you only place RNs in hospital settings), include that so we can filter accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: We build your facility list.</strong> Records are pulled from NPI registries, business directories, state licensing databases, and commercial sources. We identify decision-makers, validate contact information, and remove facilities that have closed or don't match your criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Delivered in days.</strong> Standard facility lists are ready within 3-5 business days. You receive a formatted file with a summary of record counts by facility type, geography, and specialty so your team can assign outreach territories immediately.</p>
