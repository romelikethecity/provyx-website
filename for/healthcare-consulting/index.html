    <!-- The Pain -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>You Don't Need an Enterprise License for a Three-Month Project</h2>
        <p>Healthcare consulting firms need provider data, but they don't need it the way pharma companies or hospital systems do. Your data needs are project-driven. One quarter you're sizing a market for a client entering behavioral health. The next quarter you're doing competitive analysis on primary care groups in the Southeast. Six months later you're supporting M&A due diligence on a portfolio of dental practices.</p>

<p>The problem is that the healthcare data industry is built for enterprise buyers with recurring, high-volume needs. The major vendors want annual contracts, minimum commitments, and platform fees that assume you'll be querying their database every day. For a consulting firm that needs deep data access for 8-12 weeks and then nothing for months, that pricing model is punishing. You end up paying $40,000 a year for a data license you use on three projects.</p>

<p>Some firms try to work around this by pulling data from public sources manually. The <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPI Registry</a> is free and searchable, and it contains every registered provider and organization in the country. But extracting, cleaning, and structuring that data into something useful for a market analysis takes a junior analyst a week of work. That's a week of billing you can't pass through to the client, and the output still won't have the practice-level firmographics and contact details your deliverable requires.</p>

<p>Then there's the specificity problem. Your engagement might require provider counts by specialty within specific county boundaries, or practice ownership data for a due diligence target list, or competitive landscape mapping for a specific service line. Generic databases don't slice that way. You end up buying a broad dataset and spending hours filtering it down to the 2,000 records you actually need, while paying for the 200,000 you don't.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> and CMS data releases are useful for macro-level analysis, but they don't give you practice-level intelligence. For the kind of work your clients expect, you need data that connects the macro numbers to specific practices, providers, and geographies.</p>

    <!-- How They Use Provyx -->
    <section class="content-section bg-light">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How Healthcare Consulting Firms Use Provyx</h2>
        <p>Consulting firms use Provyx as a project-scoped data source that delivers exactly what an engagement requires, without the overhead of an enterprise data license. Here's what that looks like.</p>

<p><strong>Market sizing and opportunity analysis.</strong> Your client wants to know how many providers of a specific specialty exist in a target geography, what their practice sizes look like, and where the density is highest. Provyx delivers a complete dataset filtered to those parameters: provider counts, practice locations, estimated sizes, and geographic distribution. You get the numbers your strategy deck needs without spending a week building them from scratch.</p>

<p><strong>Competitive landscape mapping.</strong> For engagements that require understanding the competitive environment, whether for a new market entry, a service line expansion, or a payer network analysis, Provyx provides practice-level data that shows who's operating where. Combine specialty filters with geography and practice size to map out the competitive terrain your client faces.</p>

<p><strong>M&A due diligence.</strong> When a private equity firm or health system is evaluating an acquisition target, they need to validate the provider roster, verify practice locations, and understand the competitive context. Provyx delivers NPI-verified provider lists, practice addresses, and market data that supports due diligence without requiring a long-term data subscription. Some firms use us for a single due diligence project and come back whenever the next deal materializes.</p>

<p><strong>Provider demographic analysis.</strong> Your engagement might require understanding the age distribution of providers in a specialty, the geographic clustering of certain practice types, or the ownership patterns in a market. Provyx data, combined with publicly available NPI and workforce data, gives your analysts the raw material for demographic modeling without starting from zero.</p>

<p><strong>Network adequacy and access analysis.</strong> For engagements with payers or state health agencies, you may need to assess provider access in specific geographies. Provyx data provides practice locations and specialty classifications at the granularity needed for access mapping and gap analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Custom data pulls for client deliverables.</strong> Sometimes you just need a specific dataset to support a slide or an appendix. A list of all dermatology practices in Texas with more than 5 providers. Every urgent care facility that opened in the last 3 years in Florida. Provyx builds these one-off pulls quickly and affordably, so you're not spending analyst time on data collection when they should be doing analysis.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- What Data You Get -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>What Data You Get in Every Record</h2>
        <p>Records are sourced from public NPI registries, business listings, and commercial databases. Standard fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Practice or facility name</strong> and <strong>DBA name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Full address</strong>, geocoded for mapping and geographic analysis</li>
<li><strong>Business phone number</strong></li>
<li><strong>Practice website URL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Owner or principal provider name</strong></li>
<li><strong>NPI number</strong> (Type 1 and Type 2) and <strong>taxonomy codes</strong></li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn profile URL</strong> where available</li>
</ul>

<p>Add-ons that consulting firms frequently request:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Practice firmographics</strong>: provider count, estimated revenue range, years in operation, number of locations, practice setting type</li>
<li><strong>Technology detection</strong>: EHR, practice management, and other technology systems in use</li>
<li><strong>Direct email addresses</strong> and <strong>mobile phone numbers</strong> (useful if the engagement includes primary research or outreach)</li>
</ul>

<p>Firmographics are the most requested add-on for consulting engagements. Practice size, revenue indicators, and multi-location data turn a simple provider list into an analytical dataset your team can model with.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="content-section bg-light">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Scope the data need.</strong> Tell us what your engagement requires: the specialties, geographies, practice characteristics, and data fields. We work with partners, analysts, and project managers depending on your firm's structure. If you're not sure exactly what filters you need, we'll help translate your research question into data parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: We build your dataset.</strong> Records are pulled, matched, and enriched from multiple sources. We structure the output to match your analytical needs, whether that's a flat list, a geographic breakdown, or a multi-tab workbook segmented by market. Quality checks are run on every deliverable before it ships.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Delivered in days.</strong> Standard datasets are ready within 3-5 business days. Complex or large-scope requests may take slightly longer. You get a formatted file plus documentation on sources, methodology, and any caveats your team should be aware of when using the data in client deliverables.</p>
